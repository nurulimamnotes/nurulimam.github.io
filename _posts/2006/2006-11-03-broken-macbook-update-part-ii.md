Looks like [Mactivate](http://www.mactivate.ie/) got it wrong, it wasn't the
heatsink, [as referred to by my earlier post][]. Looks like I have seen good
advice from the Web, never buy a first generation [Apple][] product, until
they work out the kinks! I guess Mactivate have been snowed under with
heatsink problems, that they never bothered to check other parts of my
Macbook, since it is such a common problem.They have ordered me a new "logic
board" (I am guessing the [PMU][] like I thought it was ;-) ). In other news
[Apple released a firmware update][] for those poor unfortunates that have
been suffering Random Shutdown Syndrome (or [RSS][]) for short :-D ).
Hopefully I should have it back by this Tuesday (November 7th) plus a new
heatsink and logic board.... fingers crossed anyway!
