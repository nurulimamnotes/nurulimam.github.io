While using instant messenger I had a brainwave, what will the tech landscape
look like in the future? So here is What I think could happen:  IBM will buy
Sun MicroSystems and make a new opensource OS, it will be  based on Ubuntu.
Microsoft will purchase AOL and roll out its products  on the Web, such as MS
Office, it will have a slow start to Vista,  but it will pick up through
peoples eagerness to buy the latest hardware. Google will buy Opera, invest in
Mozilla and consolidate Opera into Mozilla, it will also buy Adobe (for their
PDF format), get its way to publish an online bookstore through Google Book
Search. Yahoo will continue to buy extra companies to add to its list of a
zillion services, such as Flickr and Del.icio.us.

What do you think? Post me comments!
