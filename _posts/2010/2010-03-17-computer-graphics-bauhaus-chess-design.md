One of our projects this semester is to make a Bauhaus Chess
set in a program called 3DS Max (created by Autodesk). 3DS Max is a
modeling and animation tool built specifically for creating 3D
representations and models. Being a lover of Open Source, when we we’re
told although Blender was considered, it fell a bit short for some
reason, so we had to use 3DS Max.  
  
3DS Max is not bad to use, some of the tools are nice if your not an
arty type (like me) and prefer more technical and structured things.
Some of the effects (like glass and water) give a really nice effect to
add to the model your designing. Also as part of the project we had to
have an accompanying website, which you can view at
[bark4mark.com/bauhaus](http://bark4mark.com/bauhaus)  
  
Here’s some pictures of my chess set:

If your interested, definitely check out the website. If you like my
(pretty average I think) models and have a copy of 3DS Max, you can
[Download my .max

around with it. All my material is released under CC Attribution Non
