Just like software. it can be
really useful to open source other things in life, collaboration is
nearly always a good thing. John Buckman, CEO of Magnatune Records knows
this principle all too well. He gave a speech at a Red Hat conference a
while back, and he talked about the importance of music artists sharing
the "source", i.e. basically sharing the method of how the produced the
music in the first place. This allows easier mixing, and a higher
chamnce your work could be featured on TV or in a film, and you get paid
- the open source model applied to music.  
  
I am trying this technique with Google Docs and Spreadsheets. Once it
was launched for Google for your domain, I immeadiatley searched for
files to put on it, unfortunately, I had no such luck, all my files were
pdfs! I stumbled across my regular writely account (old Google Docs and
Spreadsheets), and found some files I had forgotten all about. I shared
my CV with some family members, and already I am getting real good
feedback, I wonder what else the open source model ccan be applied to?
