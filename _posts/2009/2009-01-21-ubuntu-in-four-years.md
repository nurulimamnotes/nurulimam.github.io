Last year was me celebrating four years of using the best 
operating system out there: [Linux][] and the best distro 
[Ubuntu][]. Ubuntu was my first foray in to Linux; and I 
haven't left it since; although I have tried all the other 
major distros. I started with the first version of Ubuntu; 
Warthy Warthog:

Warthy had a text only installer and it took me quite a while 
to not only get used to the idea of this strange operating 
system; but the fear of leaving Windows-land where all that 
power usage knowledge would mean nothing. It meant nothing 
in terms of the registry and other superficial stuff; but the 
more I used Ubuntu and Linux the more I liked it. In fact in 
2005 I ditched my XP installation altogether. I noticed there 
wasn't an Irish Ubuntu users group; so I mailed one of the 
few people (around 5 I guess) that were around Mark Shuttleworth 
to set it up and get a website going. It was an ill-advised 
effort since I was too busy with examinations really to take 
it on; so I gave it up soon after. But it is still going today, 
people are still involved.

## Hoary
Next came Hoary in 2005 and I was blown away how fast improvements 
were made; I still couldn't believe all this could be free... It 
seemed too good to be true really; I thought if Mark Shuttleworth 
ever left that would finish off Ubuntu and that would be it. While 
that might be still true; other distributions out there do 
tremendous work: Fedora is one I'd use if there were no Ubuntu.

All I can say is this: while I was definitely interested in Information 
Technology before (and knew I was heading for a Computer Science 
course); I owe a lot to Linux and Ubuntu for showing me the nitty 
gritty (that I wanted to see) and has helped me immesureably in 
my College life. Of course now that Ubuntu is one of the most 
polished Linux distrobutions out there it helps me when I need to 
get away from the nitty gritty too ;) To end this post it is only 
fitting to see the latest version:
