This is the guy who runs Stanford University Undergraduate programme. He
talks about the future of computer science:  
-   Computer Science will evolve more than most other subjects as it
    expands into other areas, especially Biology and other areas people
    don't normally associate with it
-   Industry ties with Colleges are going to be very important
-   Computer Science with Law is the next big area
