This is an old box which contained a Nokia phone from a now 
defunct Esat Digifone. Irish Businessman [Denis O'Brien][DOB] 
started it and sold it to BT and made a fortune (and after got 
[embroiled in a tribunal on accusations of impropriety][Tribunal]). 
It is now called [O2][O2Net].I thought we got ripped off now with 
call charges now, how nostalgia can prove one wrong:
