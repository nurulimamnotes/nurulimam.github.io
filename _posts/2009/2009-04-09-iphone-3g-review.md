I recently got an iPhone 3G and away from
all that Apple mania; I thought I would give an honest review. This is
framed in the mindset of all the past Nokia devices (which I have posted
about here also) which I have owned.  
  
Okay so where to start? Well I think a good place would be what I could
have bought instead. Strange place for a review; but its good to see
what is out there and what I was looking at beforehand.  
  
1. **Nokia XpressMusic 5800**
Nokia make great phones; I have stuck to the reliability of Symbian on
their earlier phones for quite some time. I love Nokia; they mean
reliability when you need your phone most - always a top feature other
manufacturers never got quite right. Maybe its part inertia on my part -
I can't really say. Long story short is that this was a major
competitor: over the iPhone it has expandability and a lot more hardware
features (like RDS Radio), can play a lot more formats also. Downsides:
Got terrible reviews for poor Symbian integration with touch; that
plectrum looks downright stupid; it is not as sleek as iPhone in form
factor (although it is smaller), screen didn't seem as good to me.

2. **HTC Magic**

up to the HTC Dream or GPhone; this Android device has probably the
coolest developer OS around. Lots of activity is going on around Android
at the moment; so the first phones to land in the UK and Ireland should
be more polished (using next gen Android: CupCake). Their is even rumors
it will be adapted and put on net books: possibly making it the standard
of mobile devices if given enough time. This will only bring more cool
apps in time and reduce Apple's iTunes Store lead. Downsides: Not
available yet; so I couldn't buy it. Doesn't have as much apps yet.
Isn't as polished in the software interface as iPhone. All of these can
be resolved with time however...  
  
  
  
3. **Palm Pre**
[![image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Palmpre.png)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/04/Palmpre.png)I
hold out a lot of hope for this! Also Linux based; it promises a cool,
open Web developer community as all the apps are online. Web apps need a
lot more thought for offline use in my opinion, so I am reserving
judgement on this. The interface seems to rock; and developing for it
looks super easy... Downsides: not out yet, thus lack of Apps and
pricing info.  
  
  
  
4. **Some junk WinMob**

it all really: a smart-phone but for less than a good plain old
non-smartphone. Always made by some obscure Taiwanese outfit - not that
is a bad thing; after-all most iPhone parts come from there. For those
on a budget this was my last option; but darn cheap; just over â‚¬115 for
one! I could have bought one for every member of my immediate family for
the price of one iPhone: makes you think, doesn't it?  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
On to the review of the iPhone:  
  
Pros:
  
**Beautiful Interface:**  
It looks amazing: lets be honest. I have never seen a phone look quite
this good.  
  
**Fingers:**  
[![image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png/636px-IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/5/5f/IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png/636px-IPhone_EDGE_and_3G.png)Using
only your hands is great; lets face it: you cannot forget your hands.
You can forget a stylus and even the iPhone itself; but those hands are
sticking with ye!  
  
**Time: **  
I use my phone for time; Apple has it displayed elegantly, in the same
place, almost in all the phones' screens. I love this as I can keep
myself aware of what I have to do next... All in glorious 24hr goodness,
they way time was meant to be displayed...  
  
**Lots of apps:**  
The App store grows bigger every day and all those little useful Apps
are really handy.  
  
**Quick Interface: **  
The software interface is very fast at getting you to where you want to
go; to that Twitter application or your Web mail etc.  
  
**Maps and Location based services:**  
I have seen the future: and it is the Internet that is location aware.
iPhone has taken the first tentative steps in this area with allowing
apps to use location; as well as building it into the camera and maps
applications.  
  
**Great iPod:**  
Apple doesn't lie on this one. It is a great iPod. The best? I haven't
decided yet... but it's not far off...  
  
**Safari:**  
[![image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Wikipedia_Main_Page_on_iPhone.png)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/6/67/Wikipedia_Main_Page_on_iPhone.png)It
is the real web you get on an iPhone. Not only that: it is surprisingly
comfortable to navigate with. I haven't seen a mobile phone device come
this close before. The N810 has a great browser with flash; but all
round Safari wins on ease of use. I heard the earlier versions were very
buggy; maybe I got in just as Safari matured properly.  
  
  
**Accelerometer:**  
Changing the view of applications as you rotate the phone was a
masterstroke. Some things just need to be viewed vertically; others
horizontally. The iPhone just makes it happen: seamlessly.. no buttons
and no fuss. Thumbs up!  
  
SO-SO
  
**Camera:**  
Not a lot to complain or praise about the camera. It does it's job...
Their is no flash or other trickery other phones have to offer; so any
sub-optimal light and the iPhone may as well just not have a camera...  
  
Cons:  
  
[![image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/IPhonehomescreen.PNG)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/IPhonehomescreen.PNG)**Cost:**  
Its darned expensive! I bought it contract-free and to say it burned a
hole in pocket is an understatement.  
  
**One Inbox:**  
Nokia has this one on the button. I don't care whether its SMS, MMS,
E-Mail or a message through telekinesis: put it in one place please...
It's easier to check; and logically it makes more sense to not have to
visit ten apps for each. Bonus points for allowing developers to hook in
things like Twitter..   
  
**Smudgy:**  
It smudges and scratches like nothing I have seen. They tried to make it
too shiny; at the cost of usability. I would prefer a grippier, less
pretty surface: but I am sure I am in a minority on this. I could
probably have even been overheard muttering "Smudgy piece of \*\*\*\*" .
Add to any price the cost of a cover...  
  
**Keyboard: **  
[![image](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/IPhone_keyboard_unblured.jpg)](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/09/IPhone_keyboard_unblured.jpg)Yes
I know how ugly hardware keyboards look: but they do work. The on-screen
keyboard to me: sucks. I much prefer the N810's on-screen one that I can
use with my thumbs. Using my index fingers just doesn't feel right; and
more to the point: all onscreen keyboards are crap. This is a major TODO
for any willing iPhone competitor...  
  
**Background Apps:**  
This may sound like a minor niggle: it's not. Only apps you can run in
the background is the phone, iPod, Safari and Mail. I don't even think
Safari and Mail are true background apps; in fact I know they aren't:
they suspend when they are not at the forefront.  
  
**Status:**  
iPhone OS 3.0 is set to fix notifications; apps will be able to display
a number next to their icon. I personally don't think that is good
enough. Is a notification area as seen on other phones (you know for
like calendar?) too much to ask? I would prefer that as the idle screen
rather than the pretty picture.  
  
**Activation:**  
I already feel Apple doesn't trust me; but to force me to run around
trying to find a computer with iTunes to activate the thing (I wasn't
near home) is just pure stupid. Do it over the air (for free; at your
expense) or just don't bother. Fail on this, major fail.  
  
**Rat race jailbreak:**  
Apple should just give up.. People are going to crack these no matter
what. You only inconvenience your customers (hint: not the networks; us
little people) with all this DRM nonsense. EA has it right: do the
minimal DRM for contract purposes.

**Pay to release even a free app:**  
Its a shame Apple thought 30% markup wasn't steep enough... But even
developer of free applications have to pay $99 to release it on the
store. It would be fine if you could get the app another way... This
just causes more junk apps to appear at a cost... If they did this on OS
X it would be suicide; why not open up the iPhone to free software?  
**  
**  
**No 3.5G:**  
I expect this was due to power; which is totally forgivable and
understandable. But a nice feature would be 3.5G for extra speed; I
expect this and 4G (WiMax?) will appear in later models..
