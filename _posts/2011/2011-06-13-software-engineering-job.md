I had been applying for jobs since I started my last year in college 
and I am delighted to say even before I completed my final year, I 
have gained full time employment. I would say it is luck, but my family 
thinks it's down to a lot of hard work and good grades! Either way, it's 
a great feeling in probably the most competitive jobs market (for potential 
employees) in years.

The job is Software Engineering on the [Java-based Cellular network control 
technology which Ericsson specialises in][OSSRC]. I have obviously signed an 
NDA (and will honour it) and at this point it goes without saying all the 
viewpoints from this website are entirely my own and nothing to do with 
Ericsson in any way.<br /><br />I'll still blog about technology, but I am 
looking forward on taking on a mobile industry slant, not necessarily about 
Ericsson. My final year project and thesis were all about the mobile software 
arena, so the mesh was perfect and I have a big interest in the technology.

It's very hard to believe this blog is 7 years in existence already! I have 
begun a process of cleaning up old posts (marking links as broken etc). Reading 
over old posts from secondary school to all the way through college and on to 
full time employment is a wonderful journey and I hope to mark the 10 year anniversary 
in 2014 with many posts about the mobile industry, just as I have through college.

Here's to many more years! ;-)
