It's been all over the tech
news world lately; apparently [Google](http://www.google.ie/) is muling
over taking Skype off of Ebay's hands. Ebay has already written down the
value of [Skype](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skype) as a large loss on
their purchase price of $2.6 billion in stock and cash. But

Skype's G-branded future be any better?  
  
I think it would be. Skype is a strong international brand for voice
calls, instant messaging and video calls; but of course it competes
directly with Google Talk. Skype as a company has made a lot of
mistakes; but they actually produces some of the best technology for p2p
VOIP out there in the marketplace. Skype is particularly strong in
redundancy, cost of network operation (since it's p2p every user
carries' each others traffic; most people have no idea of this fact) and
routing around the most draconian network admins out their through their
routers.  
  
All of this is a strict propreitary network and is centrally controlled
at the moment for Ebay. All voice is encrypted accross Skype; but it is
well-speculated that Skype has a back door to snoop on anyone it so
wishes (although it would never publicly admit to this). Legislation
hasn't caught up to protect voice calls like they are on "traditional"
PSTN [Pretty Simple Telephone Network].  
  
I think Google could open up Skype's network; to what extent is anyone's
guess. I hope they integrate XMPP like Gmail Chat capability (which is
an open standard); and do the same for voice/video (could take a while
based on patents) . I predict the client will most likely stay
propreitary and closed-source; as opening it up could reveal back-doors;
patent and copyright issues and more. But overall I think the
transaction could go quite well for both parties...
