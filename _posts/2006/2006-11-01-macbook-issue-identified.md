Turns out my prediction wasn't quite correct, it was not the Power Management
Unit ([PMU][]), it was the heatsink. [Mactivate][] have informed me they have
one on order from [Apple][], so it will take a bit longer than I anticipated
to get my [Macbook][] back. I found this strange as I had not experienced
random shutdowns like the ones that have been widely reported across the web.
it was like I described in my earlier post, something to do with the battery
not being able to charge. Then again, I am no expert on this and their is wide
evidence (over 1600 people have identified heatsink as a problem in their
Macbooks) that the heatsink is a definite issue. Sounds like good or bad I
will have a lot more to say about Apple Computer in the future, thats why I
have decided to add them as a category.
