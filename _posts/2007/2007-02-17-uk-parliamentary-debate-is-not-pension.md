I found this doing a search for Domino
Records DRM. I [looked up some of my favourite
artists](http://www.riaaradar.com/ "RIAA Radar") to see if they were
part of the "MAFIAA" that is the
[RIAA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIAA "Recording Industry Association of America")
(Recording Industry Association of America), not surprisingly some were
(70% of sold music worldwide is put out by this cartel). I got rather
confused when a Franz Ferdinand album appeared on the list, when their
debut album did not. Seems the record label did a deal with Sony for
distribution. I found a piece of information quite old now (May 2006),
but interesting anyway:  
> "Opponents also challenge the idea that back catalogue revenues
> provide investment for new ventures and to support new artists. Peter
> Jameson of the BPI (British Phonographic Industry) argued in The
> Guardian on 24 April that such investment had contributed to a boom in
> new British music, citing artists such as Arctic Monkeys, James Blunt
> and Kaiser Chiefs. However, Arctic Monkeys are with Domino Records,
> which was founded in 1993 and rarely re-releases records that predate
> itself, and James Blunt was signed by the US label Custard Records,
> which was set up only in 2004 and so has little back catalogue
> material to release; the same is true of Kaiser Chiefs, who are signed
> to B-Unique, which was also founded in 2004. Those are hardly good
> examples of recording companies that rely on significant revenue from
> the back catalogue profits that would be under threat if we were to
> stick at the 50-year copyright term." ( Via [Digital Rights

I find the whole [Digital Rights
Management](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Rights_Management "Digital Rights Management")
thing very interesting, will the greedy dinosaurs of the recording
industry win? Or will technologists like [Corey
Doctorow](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1904758034876244745&q=corey+doctorow+drm+microsoft "Corey Doctorows DRM Talk at Microsoft")
or [Steve
Jobs](http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/ "Steve Jobs ")
suceed in getting the point across? After all you don't see many
technologists being record bosses!
