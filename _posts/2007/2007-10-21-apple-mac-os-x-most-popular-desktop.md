Apple does it again: explosive growth in the computer market,
no doubt in part to its
[Macbook](http://www.apple.com/macbook/macbook.html)/[Macbook
Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) line of laptops. As [Ars
Technica](http://arstechnica.com/) points out:  
> As [predicted last
> quarter](http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/07/19/apple-poised-to-become-number-three-pc-maker-in-us),

Here's the graph of the figures:

Is it the most popular desktop
[UNIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UNIX)? No, as until
[Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/) comes out it is not officially a
UNIX stamped and sealed [POSIX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX)
compliant system; but then again neither is
[Linux](http://www.kernel.org/). Apple has the benefit of reporting
numbers with hard sales; something thats impossible for Linux. With
estimates of 22 million Mac users, compared to
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) and [Fedora](http://fedoraproject.org/)
(the two most popular user-friendly distributions) which reported 8
million dynamic [IP's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IP_address) updating
from mirrors (16 million total). That doesn't include
[SuSe](http://www.novell.com/linux/), [Red Hat](http://redhat.com/),
[Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/), [Debian](http://debian.org/),
[Mandriva](http://mandriva.com/) and other popular distributions, which
means Linux has most likely a bigger install base, although Apple is
gaining ground fast. As [Rob Malda](http://cmdrtaco.net/) (founder of
popular geek news site: [Slashdot](http://www.slashdot.org/))
[said](http://meta.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/10/11/1527219):  
> Linux will have a strong position on the server for a long time, but
> as [GNOME](http://www.gnome.org/) and [KDE](http://www.kde.org/)
> bickered with each other,
> [Appl](http://www.apple.com/)[e](http://www.apple.com/) came along and
> gave the world a [great desktop UNIX](http://www.apple.com/macosx/).
> It's sad, but true, and there's a huge lesson to learn there.
