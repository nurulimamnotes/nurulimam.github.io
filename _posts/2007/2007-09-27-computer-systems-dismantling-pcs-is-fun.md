I found a new pastime: dismantling pc's. It my not sound like great
fun, but its a challenge to do it right and make sure you don't break
your pc at the end of it all. Nothing feels of so much relief when you
see the BIOS boot up again after ripping everything you can out and
cramming it all back in. It stands to you in developing problem solving
skills, which of course employers love. It is so much more visual than
any theory, plus it is what the majority of people like: physical
objects like Lego going together. I am writing this on a computer I
stripped everything out of at the moment: a Dell 3100c, a Celeron D
machine I bought in August of last year. Today I dismantled a very old
Optiplex PIII, and the difference between the machines is marked, even
though there are only a few years between them. I have included some
photos below to show the inside internals:
