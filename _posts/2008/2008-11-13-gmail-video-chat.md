I am an avid [Gmail](http://mail.google.com/) user through Google Apps.
I use the calender, chat, code, sites, pages, docs the whole lot. One of
my friends even jokes "You should just work at Google Marketing". Yes I
like most of Google's products; but I am a products guy; I use whats
good, cheap and fast (pick two). Google has the cheap down due to
ad-revenue; for the moment anyways in the current financial turmoil.  
  
So I was delighted when I seen [Gmail Video and
Voice](http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/say-hello-to-gmail-voice-and-video-chat.html)
released. I have used it on my computer and I can say thats its really
good: better than
[SIP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_Initiation_Protocol) video;
better than [Skype](http://www.skype.com/intl/en/) on the quality front.
Google Talk has always had the clearest voice calling from my usage of
it vs. the others.  
  
My family use Gmail; I have converted almost everyone I know to use it.
Most of my Computer Science class have it (some just use the student
hotmail); so I will really use this feature. There are a few problems
however:  
-   [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/) itself has no video; a
    curious decision
-   It is not encrypted like Skype; there should be an option
-   No Linux client: Unbelievable when Mac OS X is supported!
-   Not compatible with Nokia Internet Tablets; an early testbed for
    Google Talk Video
-   Open Standards but not Open Source: patent issues with licensed
    video codecs   

Features missing which would really benefit me as a CS student:  
-   Multi-way voice calling
-   Multi-way Video calling
-   Whiteboard function (Integration into GDocs?)  
-   Compatibility with SIP video
-   Scheduling of Video/Voice through resource availibility option in
    Google Calendar

These are mainly organisational for group projects etc. which would be
very handy not only to me; but business through apps and Google the
company itself. Get working on it [Google](http://www.google.ie/)!
