Wow... what a weird feeling, I have a degree under my belt. Three 
years, many friends and a lot of hard work later! The degree itself 
was based on my father's business Grogan Burner Services, and trying 
to solve a real world problem of using Excel spreadsheets. We used 
[Python][], [Google App Engine][] and a lot of Javascript to create a 
modern, sleek [Customer Relationship Management][crm] system. All the 
code is open source, under [GPLv3][]. Our thesis, including code is 
available below for those interested. We got top honours for the 
submission in [ITB][].

BIMsys Thesis - Available soon

NB. I can't license the the thesis myself under Creative Commons. For now, 
full copyright credit goes to Grogan, Howard and MacTiernan 2010.
