I come into contact everyday with people asking how to fix
their machines due to the inevitable spyware and viruses found on a
Windows machine. Lately I have been switching people to
[Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/), and even getting them to buy machines
to install it on ([Dell](http://www.dell.com/open)). But I understand
and have no zealotry for Linux when it comes to fixing peoples' real
world problems. I always mention [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) as a
matter of course, and also [Macs](http://www.apple.com/mac). I follow up
peoples Ubuntu installs with friendly emails explaining the free help
open to them, but also as common (probably moreso) are my emailed tips
to people guiding them how to fix there Windows XP computer. So I'll
list the steps here which are generic and should help anyone out their
with such problems; this is not a miracle cure and I fix these problems
on a case by case basis, so expect better perfromance, but not a new
computer!!  
> 1.  Go to Control Panel (Click on My Computer, then a link to it
>     appears at the side) \> Add/Remove Programs
> 2.  Remove all Norton Antivirus and/or Symantec Security products
> 3.  Download This: [Avast Home Edition
>     4](http://files.avast.com/iavs4pro/setupeng.exe)
> 4.  When Avast installs and asks to perform a boot time scan, click:
>     yes, then restart your computer as it suggests  
> 5.  [Register for a (free) Avast Home Edition 4 Serial
>     key](http://www.avast.com/eng/home-registration.php)  
> 6.  Start Avast from the Start Menu (Start \> All Programs \> Avast).
>     It will flash an "A" on a round ball in the status area, click it
>     and enter serial number recieved in email  
> 7.  Download: [Spybot Search and
>     Destroy](http://www.spybotupdates.com/files/spybotsd14.exe)
> 8.  It will guide you through this when it starts up the first time:
>     Backup your registry, download all available updates, immunise and
>     then do a full scan (it sounds harder then it is), then remove all
>     spyware

I should also mention the open source [ClamAV](http://www.clamav.net/),
but I find Avast more suitable for this guide. I hope this helps fix
issues that people have. I hate to see new computers being bought every
day when the old ones can be made to run very fast with the right amount
of TLC!
