Nokia have
announced an upgrade to the N800 Internet tablet, called the N810. I
suspect its called that because it is more of an incremental upgrade
than a total visual refresh it was going from an Nokia 770 to N800. Here
it is:

It sports a nice new hardware keyboard; inbuilt GPS (For satellite
mapping) and OS 2008 (an upgrade to the operating system it runs). The
N800 will also benefit from OS 2008, which will include GoogleTalk,
Skype, Mozilla browser, among the usual such as its email client, media
player, file manager, control panel, assorted games and an image/PDF
viewer. The one feature it will emit is an inbuilt FM Radio, which was
axed to make the N810 a smaller tablet. It still retains the best screen
size for web browsing, bluetooth connectivity, and of course Wifi which
is central to the tablets existance! No word on what easter eggs are
included if any; on the N800 it was a radio and the N770 it was the
microphone. [Engadget has a great writeup on
