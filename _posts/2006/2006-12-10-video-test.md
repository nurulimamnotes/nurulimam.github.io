I recently got a hold of my Christmas present in advance, a new Nokia 6234
from Vodafone Ireland. I did a short video test, maybe this could be the start
of my VideoBlogging career:  
  
  
Well maybe not! But I do hope to have more videos on my blog! The video is of
me describing my living quarters and about my laptop. I needed to be a bit
closer to the phone as hearing me is difficult sometimes (not so in real
life!), but basically I just point out what you see and explain the phone
won't sync address+calendar with my macbook :-( (My old phone did just that
:-) ). I don't really mind, bluetooth works a charm and I can exchange files
between it. All I need now is a super 2GB mini memory card, for some quick
music on the go!
