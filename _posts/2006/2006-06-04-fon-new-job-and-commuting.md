I regularly read other Irish blogs to see whats happening and whats the latest
tech thing amongst others. It seems that may have come to fruition, with FON,
a community wifi project, sending me out a free router!! I am exicted about
this, as I hope to convince all my neighbours eventually to get it, and maybe
who knows, I may even achieve the biggest fon hotspot, if I take my campaign
estate wide, to neighbours all around! I want to “eat my own dog food” as they
say, so I will wait until I have recieved and used my router before I
recommend it to non-technical people. I have read of long delays on FON’s
forums, so I expect iot should be here within two to three weeks, maybe a
little longer. Also it comes with a european plug, not a Irish/British one,
which is a bit of a disappointment that I will have to root out the
screwdriver to make it fit!!!

Also, I was recently employed by the Irish National Lottery contractors, GTECH
Ireland Operations, part of GTECH Corporation (who trade as **GTK** on New
York Stock Exchange). It was voted one of the fifty best places to work last
year. I am very exicited at the prospect, as I will gain many insights on the
life of working. They own a number of franchise lotterys around the world,
including the United Kingdom, Portugal and Spain.   I also, as part of my new
job, join the Dublin commute. Iarnrod Eireann, while after coming on in recent
years is a fine company, I still believe it has a long way to go. The lack of
a cheap, clean and friendly transport system does hurt Dublin in terms of
tourism and business, of that I have no doubt. I was recently in Rome, which
you get 75 minutes unlimited travel on the bus, plus one metro journey, all
for, get this, €1! Yes you read that correctly €1! Why can’t we do this? I
think we can, but we need an integrated transport system first. How come after
all these years you still cannot get a ticket for Bus, Train and Luas in one?
Thats what baffles me the most, and it could make a huge difference, one
ticket!
