[Microsoft has settled with
Eolas](http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single9119)
over a number of patents regarding browser plugins which chicago based
Eolas filed patents for in 1998. A jury in Chicago then found Microsoft
guilty of infringing on Eolas’ patents and was told to pay $521m US
Dollars in 'damages'. That ruling was overturned and a fresh trial
ordered which was due to start very soon, but it seems Microsoft has
decided to pay out:

I think it is a sign of a deep crisis in the technology industry as a
whole when companies have to pay out over patents over which the holder
has no product. With patents there should be a use em' or lose em'
theme. My biggest concern now is that I hope Microsoft are not trying to
validate the patent by paying out and then encouraging Eolas to use it
against competitors, [sort of like the Apple and Creative
deal](http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060823-7575.html) comes to
mind.
