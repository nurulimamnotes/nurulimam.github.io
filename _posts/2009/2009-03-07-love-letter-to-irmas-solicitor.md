* This post is a continuation on the previous one. IRMA is the Irish
Music Rights Organisation which represents the big four record companies
and their bottom line: never the artist. They have recently tried to
regulate the Internet and have forced the biggest Irish ISP: Eircom; to
use the three strikes rule and boot people off the Internet... No Judge,
no Jury, no evidence of a crime.. Just an IP address and a sanction
which you cannot contest.  
  
*
I have sent a poignant email to IRMA's solicitor based on their letter
of attack on the ISP's. If you think any of the language is too harsh by
me; [please have a look at a sample of the threat letter this solicitor
sent out here](http://blog.blacknight.com/images/irmaletter.pdf). This
is a legal firm who were suing individuals for thousands of euro; which
I would hazard a guess most couldn't pay. So in my eyes this is a form
of legal terrorism; and a joke letter to give this solicitor a heads up
that there are people out there like me who read and know the tactics of
the Irish Music Rights Organisation; and the parent companies like IFPI,
RIAA and the Anit-Piracy Bureau they spring from.... It is my opinion
that nothing short of punishment (jail time) for frivolous threat
letters should be carried out, plus damages (x10 like they do in their
cases) to individuals and companies wrongly stressed out by this. I will
compile a blog post of all the FUD (Fear, Uncertainty and Doubt) that
IRMA has spread soon; and a rebuttal of why their actions may even
increase piracy. One thing is for sure; my analysis will be a whole lot
cheaper (free) and probably more accurate!  
  
**Note:** I have taken out names, but the legal firm and the acting
solicitor can be examined in the letter above \^

Rest assured I will publish any response; but I don't expect one....
