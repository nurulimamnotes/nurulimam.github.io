Some really informative stuff on Slashdot regarding nuclear power:

This was the opposite "self-regulating --- temperature goes up, power
output goes down" in Chernobyl. You'll have to forgive me as I wasn't
born then. It was re-iterated differently also:

The main article was about running Nuclear plants over capicity (120%
quoted) and putting contracts up for renewal when possible some plants
should be end-of-lifed (EOL). Another submitter had an interesting point
on the extended life:

Chernobyl obviously is used in spades in either side of the argument.
Those who favour Nuclear power point out that it can never happen again.
Those who are against it use it as an example of what has happend with
us mere mortals.

One thing I love Slashdot for is the informative links, like the one

One point we should never forget is that Chernobyl has concentrated the

There was also well versed points that Coal plants would not meet the
requirements if it was subject to Nuclear safety regulations. The bulk
of the cost of Nuclear is in the safety of the plant and fuel
reprocessing/dumping. Most have pointed out it's quite viable to end up
with very small amounts of lesser grade material with modern
reprocessing.

Why all these comments? Well I wish we had a debate like this in
Ireland. We are bar none the most reliant on fossil fuels (of which we
produce almost none). Everytime it's brought up in the media, ESB and
people who represent them or are in the industry say (paraphrased)
"Thats a matter for the 2030's". If you know it takes at least 20 years
to get us up to speed (importing technology and people from France, UK
etc) then why aren't we having a debate now and a plan of action after 5
years, 2014/5 and beyond? There was an old Nuclear power board in the
80's but it was disbanded on account of the Carnsore point objections.

I firmly believe we have the power to think broader now, like we have on
divorce, civil partnerships and so forth. That stuff could not have been
implemented from what I understand in the 80's either. Times move on and
attitudes change. If we had a debate and the facts, I'm sure supporters
of Nuclear energy in Ireland like myself would at least get an educated
debate going - as it's our energy future and money.
