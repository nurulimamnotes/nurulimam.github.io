am not a big gamer; I primarily love systems and how they work. I do own
a [PS3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3) ([amazing
hardware](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_3_hardware) I might
add) and I prefer
[FPS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-person_shooter) and generally
devious natured video games (like the
[GTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_(series))
franchise). Does that make me a bad person who wants to kill people? Of
course not; nothing could be further from the truth. But some people
stick their fingers in their ears and shout "LA LA LA
[Columbine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbine_High_School_massacre)
LALALA Terrorists LALALA Violent Video Games!". They say it is
destructive to childrens young precious minds. The "[Think of The
Children](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/For_The_Children_(politics))"
argument always disgusted me; its like shouting Fire in a packed room
when their is no danger: it is false, just to garner attention and a
sickening twisted version of the facts. Are violent video games harmful
to kids? *Probably*; I wouldn't advocate giving them access since they;
just like movies are [**clearly rated for
Adults**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan_European_Game_Information). *

is so hard to understand about that?* Its is clearly an issue of
parenting and morals whether you allow your child access to such
material. So it is clear the real issue is the lack of proper guidance
by parents; either to not bother enforcing the ratings, block their
children from receiving them as gifts, or monitor to check if they spend
pocket money on such items. They gladly do so for other adult items like
adult content, movies, cigarettes and alcohol; why not video games?
Today's consoles even have ratings built-in (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360) which
are enforceable by a password the parent can set. This makes it a breeze
to block adult games and really hard for the average child (never mind
adult) to circumvent. They could still play it at a friends house of
course; you can't lock your children down, but even so you can actively
limit their exposure to such material. The study points out what others
and I have always known: Video games don't corrupt a mind by themselves,
other factors (mainly social/upbringing) have a much bigger impact
