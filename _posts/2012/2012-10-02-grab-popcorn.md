Fresh from the "interesting but pointless facts" desk comes this little kernel (I apologise!) of truth:

>In 2002, the British Film Institute depicted popcorn as "the most profitable substance on the planet, more than heroin, more than plutonium". Typically, the popcorn we eat costs less to produce than the very container it comes in. - <a href="http://www.afoodieworld.com/en/features/all-features/articles/popcorn.html">Foodie World</a>

Further research indicates that isn't quite true - antimatter is the most expensive substance in the world. But for a common, everyday item, it's very expensive indeed. There's a lot less risk in production then Heroin and a lot bigger market the Plutonium, for instance.<br />

It's timely however with agriculture prices rising world-wide, that at least some of that huge profit margin may fall victim to market conditions. I think the Movie theatres might survive just fine, however.
