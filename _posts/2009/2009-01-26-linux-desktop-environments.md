What are Desktop Environments? Wikipedia defines it as:

> In graphical computing, a **desktop environment** (**DE**) commonly
> refers to a style of [graphical user
> interface](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface "Graphical user interface")
> ...... A desktop environment typically consists of
> [icons](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icon_(computing) "Icon (computing)"),
> [windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Window_(computing) "Window (computing)"),
> [toolbars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toolbar "Toolbar"),
> [folders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_(file_systems) "Directory (file systems)"),
> [wallpapers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_wallpaper "Computer wallpaper"),
> and [desktop
> widgets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widget_engine "Widget engine").

I would add a [file manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_manager)
and [browser](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_browser) to this list
also! Let's look at the two most popular consumer Operating Systems (in
three variants) and their Desktop Environments:

**OS Name**
**Widgets**
**Window Manager**
**File Manager**
**Browser**
Windows XP
Luna
Stack Window Manager
Windows File Explorer
Internet Explorer 6
Windows Vista
Aero
[Desktop Window
Manager](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desktop_Window_Manager "Desktop Window Manager")
[Windows File Explorer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Explorer)
[Internet Explorer 7](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer)
Mac OS X
Cocoa
Quartz Compositor
[Finder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software))
[Safari 2.X](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser))
Now take Linux; really a Kernel, but packaged means an Operating System.
Which way you package it makes all the difference! You still use the
same drivers, the boot process is still the same, but when your machine
finishes its boot and launches all that graphics stuff anything can
appear: **anything**. It's abstraction to have no real graphics in a
kernel other than that which are drivers to control hardware. This is
very strange to people who think in the Windows way (nb. I used to be
one of these). At the end of Windows XP booting I have never seen
anything but Luna; and most people don't know its called that. So it is
very strange for people my age and slightly older who grew up over DOS
and Windows 3.1/95 line to have this fundamental shift in logic.

When most people say Linux they 'never' (*as Home Desktop user*)
normally mean the Kernel; they mean 'Gnome', 'KDE', 'Fluxbox',
'Enlightenment' and I could go on! To confuse further; people who say
Linux may mean 'Ubuntu', 'Fedora', 'OpenSuse', 'Mandriva' which are all
packaged versions of Linux Kernel with a Desktop Environment such as
Gnome or KDE (and GNU Toolkit). So here's the table:

**Desktop Environment**
**Widgets**
**Window Manager**
**File Manager**
**Browser**
[Gnome](http://www.gnome.org/)
[GTK2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+)
[Metacity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metacity)
[Nautilus](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus_(file_manager))
Firefox/ Ephiphany
[KDE](http://www.kde.org/)
[QT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qt_(toolkit))
[KWin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kwin)
[Dolphin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolphin_(software))/[Konqueror](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konqueror)
Konqueror
[XFCE](http://www.xfce.org/)
[GTK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTK+)
[Window Manager](http://www.xfce.org/projects/xfwm4/)
[Thunar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunar)
[Midori](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midori_(browser))
### The interesting part...

Yes there really was a point to all of this rambling! The point is the
you are not bound to any graphical way in Linux:* there is none*. It is
completely your choice what you choose to use. If you go with a
pre-package distribution the choice is made: Ubuntu uses Gnome, Kubuntu
uses KDE, and Xubuntu uses XFCE. The really neat part: all can co-exist
happily on the same machine. I have KDE, Gnome and XFCE all installed
right now. I can open up Konqueror in Gnome; Thunar in KDE and Epiphany
in XFCE. All my KDE programs appear in my Gnome menu and vice-versa;
same with XFCE. This is a strange concept from being able to use say Mac
OS X Finder on Windows: it can't be done! Open source plays nice ;) Now
for the part I like; lovely screenshots to help you on your journey to
choose!

**Gnome 2.20**
**KDE 4**
**XFCE**
**Enlightenment**
  
  
**NB.** I wrote this post as I noticed some in my Computer Science class
struggled with this concept, in many ways I couldn't understand this at
first either... so I just thought what would normal people think? My
response is this post; with a few screenshots to hopefully brighten
things up! [Wikipedia has a more in-depth comparison of X11
Linux-compatible Desktop environments
