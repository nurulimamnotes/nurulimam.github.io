I got a Plantronics .655 USB Headset mainly for the ability to do VOIP well. 
Those of you who come here often know [I reviewed Sennheiser HD595 before][Senn], 
which is a headset built for the quality of reproduction (I use that one for music).

There's not much you can say about a VOIP headset, so I am going to keep this short! 
The Plantronics .655 USB isn't the most comfortable headset and the usb connection 
seemed like a plus as I'd never owned a USB headset. The mic quality is a lot better 
with the USB connection (though I am guessing 90% is down to the fact it's directional 
and pointed at your mouth), but the sound won't be.

Plantronics has basically discontinued this product although you can still buy it. 
If price is an issue, I recommend this as a decent headset, if not a tad disappointing 
in the comfort stakes. Plantronics have newer models out similar to this - some more 
expensive and some cheaper. If the price point is a winner, they offer decent value for money.
