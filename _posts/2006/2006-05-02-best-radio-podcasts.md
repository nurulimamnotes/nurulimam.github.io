Even while podcasts are relatively new (well a couple of years - like blogs),
Irish Radio Stations are surprisingly well in on the act. Even our incumbent
state broadcaster, RTE, is podcasting en-masse on both RTE Radio 1 and RTE
2FM. To recieve podcasts, you need podcasting software, start by getting
[Juice Reciever](http://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php)(Formerly
iPodder), available for Linux, BSD, MAC and Windows. I will start with my top
5 Irish Radio podcasts:

1.  [Matt Cooperâ€™s The Last
    Word](http://audio.todayfm.com/lwpodcasting.xml), [Today
    FM](http://www.todayfm.com/)
2.  [The Weekly Ryan, Gerry
    Ryan](http://www.rte.ie/2fm/podcast/podcast_gerryryan.xml), [RTE
    2FM](http://www.rte.ie/2fm/)
3.  [Breakfast Show with Eamon
    Dunphy](http://www.newstalk106.ie/podcasts/Breakfast.xml), [NewsTalk
    106](http://www.newstalk106.ie/) (Dublin-Based)
4.  [The Saturday Show](http://www.rte.ie/2fm/thesaturdayshow.html),
    [RTE 2FM](http://www.rte.ie/2fm/)
5.  [The Tubridy
    Show](http://www.rte.ie/rams/radio/latest/rte-thetubridyshow.smil),
    [RTE Radio 1](http://www.rte.ie/radio1/)

Now for my Top Technology Related Podcasts:

1.  [Lug Radio](http://www.lugradio.org/episodes.rss)
2.  [BBC Digital
    Planet](http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/rmhttp/downloadtrial/worldservice/digitalplanet/rss.xml)
3.  [Diggnation](http://revision3.com/diggnation/feed/high.mp3.xml)

Most importantly, all of the above are free, some even are advertising free
(Lug Radio, Digital Planet, Ryan Weekly).This is not a definitive list, only a
select few popular ones that I myself listen to. If you want to suggest more,
go ahead, tell me whats the best podcasts in your area, I would be interested
to know! In the meantime, hours of listening lies ahead of you, mp3 players at
the ready. Also almost all are update continually, so more to listen to every
day!
