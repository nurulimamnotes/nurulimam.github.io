I purchased the iPhone 4 shortly after its release in Summer 2010. 
I have obviously been so quick to review this device,  the iPhone 5 
is upon us! My philosophy for reviewing items is you **have to live with them**. 
Well boy have I lived with my iPhone 4! As I write this on it, I do 
marvel at how good the hardware is. I've dropped this extremely expensive 
device on occasions <i>too numerous to count</i>, so luckily it is designed well.


### Apps

I have a very large collection of paid apps, two-thirds of which have been 
impulse buy, maybe I'll need them someday types. It's a very expensive 
platform to get involved with, for sure - but the quality of some apps 
has been far better than their desktop counterparts - the one that 
springs to mind is Tweetie (now Twitter for iPhone). Some unforgettable 
games that take great advantage of the platform have sprung up - my 
favourite by far is Cut the Rope. Another is Angry Birds. None of these 
or any games I've played have made really good use of the iPhone 4's 
sensors of which there are many - Gyroscope, Accelerometer, Compass, 
Camera etc.  Sure I've played driving games but I always feel stupid 
using the iPhone as a mock steering wheel. If you're an app junkie like 
myself, check out AppAdvice (yes another app) for nice and easy reviews. 
I've also found Lifehacker hive five series for iOS help inform me when 
there's a number of popular apps for a platform.

### Camera
One of the best features of the iPhone 4 is without a doubt the camera. 
It'll obviously never replace an&nbsp;SLR and my compact point and 
shoot HP Camera is still better but that's all negated by the ease 
of use of iPhone camera. It's with you all the time and has the 
best sharing tools (and quick editing tools) of any camera out there. 
Great Camera related apps include Flickr, Instagram, Toonpaint and 
the included Photos app. I've shared more photos directly on a one-to-one 
basis than ever before, usually after I take the picture with my iPhone - 
someone requests it and I mail it or upload to Flickr or Instagram seamlessly. 
It's definitely the future of photos, the past was hovering around 
a device or printed photos.

### Conclusion
People still are in awe of the iPhone 4 and personally I don't think 
that's justified or justifiable any more. Yes its beautiful hardware 
and software, but the competition has caught up to Apple. It's still 
the best out there as far as I can see, but by that measure it's also 
far too expensive. I've used mine for App development and even still, 
as a power user, I think the price is the single biggest turn off. 
iPhones do hold their value, which is a relief, should you wish to 
switch platforms or upgrade to iPhone 5. So my recommendation? If you 
have iPhone lust - buy one - but be ruthless and be willing to sell it 
on within 12 months to get something better... that something is up to 
you!
