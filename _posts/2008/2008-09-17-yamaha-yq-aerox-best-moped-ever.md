Well I
think so! Got one there 2 months ago and forgot to write a blog post
about it. I got a '01 model for a bargain price I believe; but this
theory has yet to be tested (I'll wait for a year to be up). As I
mentioned before in previous posts my parent's house is now in a remote
location with no train/buses anywhere nearby. So transport was
essential! At this time also there was a major crack down on learner
drivers not being accompanied by a fully licensed driver (of two years).
So by the time I'd saved the money for the car; got 10 lessons and
convinced anyone I knew with over two years full driving experience to
accompany me; even to work - was just to much hassle - hence the moped
which has no such onerous requirements. In fact only one it does really
have is that you can't have passengers - I won't be carrying anyone
anyways - so I am not too bothered. Anyhoo take a look at the photos I
took when I got it. I have done it up since then: new tyres, resprayed
exhaust, full service; new mirrors; repaired exhaust; flushed out
radiator and put in proper coolant just to name a few. So it sounds
allot better and drives better than ever!
