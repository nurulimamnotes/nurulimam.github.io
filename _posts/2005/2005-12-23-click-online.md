In case you have never looked at it, Click Online is the flagship  technology
program for the BBC. It broadcasts on the Internet and can  be viewed even on
a 56k modem. I have been watching click online for  over a year and a half
now, I first saw it on BBC World, while holidaying  in Portugal. It also
broadcasts on BBC News 24 at 7am on a Sunday morning  (I have never seen it at
this time!). Although by its nature a technical  program, it is very much
aimed at the average PC user and so most things  are explained fully.
