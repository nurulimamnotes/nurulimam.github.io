Well apparently I am a new kid on the block, according to the [Irish Blog
awards blog][]). Irish Blog Awards from what I can gather is a new event,
hoping to happen in March 2007. They have an impressive list of backers, so I
expect significant (although maybe minor) coverage in the media. Unfortunately
they called it Duey Fensters, but I thank them for the link nonetheless! These
are the categories that will be adjudicated on:

-   Best Blog
-   Best Blog Post
-   Most Humorous Post
-   Best Photo Blog
-   Best Arts and Culture Blog
-   Best Political Blog
-   Best Group Blog
-   Best Personal Blog
-   Best Use of the Irish Language in a Blog
-   Best Contribution to the Irish Bloggersphere
-   Best Technology Blog/Blogger
-   Best Designed Blog
-   Best Sport & Recreation Blog
-   Best News/Current Affairs Blog
-   Best Specialist Blog
-   Best Newcomer
-   Best Business Blog
-   Best Music Blog
-   Best Podcast
-   Best Podcaster
-   Best videocast

Well if you think I will fit into any of these categories, let me know. I'll
keep an eye on the event, and update you when the nominating begins! I think
it would be rather cool to win something, anything really!
