On holidays in Lithuania recently I was eating in a restaurant and noticed the music was all in English. It's not the first time I've noticed a non English speaking country playing all English songs in bars, restaurants and taxis. Rather what was unusual was the very few ads and the fact it was an American station.

I'm no fan of ads, and am a huge fan of audio in general - be it spoken word or music. I'm a Spotify subscriber, but I also get bored if my own playlists fairly quickly. Spotify Radio isn't the solution and I can't access Pandora easily outside the US. 181 fm has a huge choice of stations (although I need a Smiths/Cure type of station) and plays few ads. It takes a little time to try out feeds they have, and some songs are on heavy rotation like regular music radio but it's a nice service. Give it a try
