Ikea the TV Business? Who would have forseen the day. After looking at their
video I must say I can see the reasons quite clearly: TV's look awkward in 
almost everyones home. They don't fit in our units, the cables are in awkward
 positions and you can never find the remote[^1]. I'm a fan of all things cheap and
 Ikea I must confess, so I'll be watching this development with great interest!
