(or The Onion Router) is a service which connects people all over the
world with one aim: privacy. Tor protects from traffic analysis,
basically where you have been. Benn to you Banks website? Feel like
buying something off Amazon or Ebay? Your behaviour online is by no
means private, you hand over your numerical address, browser details,
country, city, versions of which plugins you use, where you came from,
just to name a few. You may have seen on sites something to the effect
of "Welcome Google user!", that website knows exactly what you typed to
get to it. Tor routes your online activity through different computers,
for example mine went through an educational institution in the US and
an Internet Service Provider in the Netherlands.  
  
But if you want privacy you have something to hide! Not true. You don't
hand over records of everywhere[![Tor

you go in reality, nor documents, or details of medical conditions etc.,
their is a genuine use case for privacy in the modern world which is
sadly being eroded. I just watched ABC news repeat on Sky News, and it
reported of the FBI sending letters out asking for information from
librarys, banks and every institution inbetween. It involved no court,
no checks and balances, nothing. Tor is also used by the law itself, to
conceal government surveillance of illegal activity (for example, child
pornography). So not only is Tor needed, but it can extend to everything
online, Instant Messaging. Tor limits abuse with a high degree of
success and it is cross platform, on Linux, Windows and Mac. Get it
