So I was listening to some music, thinking about the announcement 
today on Anglo Irish Bank that we have 32% national debt and 
my generation will be expected to pay that. Kind of depressing 
if you ask me, but no one does, ’cause the media has got that 
one all wrapped up. So I asked myself, is their anything new 
we can learn, while I was listening to the *Prodigy* classic� *Breathe*.
So I came to the realisation there can't be anything added, or can there?

>Breathe the pressure
>Come play my game I'll test ya
>Psycho-somatic addict insane

That is a line from the song *Breathe*� it fits beautifully with what 
Ireland is experiencing! Breathe the pressure is the financial markets 
bailing down on us – while come play my game is what the Government 
is doing, going back to those markets. **Psycho-somatic addict insane**� 
is perhaps the most poetic, as it symbolises the irrational nature of 
markets, and how we are like junkies on the delicious debt we can't live 
without (but are insane to go too deep on). If that got you thinking, 
I'll leave you with the line from *Breathe* that shouls horrify us all:

>Inhale, inhale, **you're the victim**
