I've written [about my desire for open web video before][OtherPost], 
and now it looks as if it's finally going to happen. Lead by Google's 
acquisition of [On2 technologies][On2], the [VP8][] codec has been 
renamed as "[WebM][]" and open sourced. [Vorbis][] will be the audio. 
[Matroska][] the container for the new format. An Open Source developer 
for x264 does a [great teardown of the format vs. h.264 here][teardown].
The patent minefield stateside is still not clear by any means, but with 
a strong backer like Google, it's probably the best protection your going 
to get. Announcements, including links to nightlies, dev and beta channel 
browsers with WebM support are below:<
