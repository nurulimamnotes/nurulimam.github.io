I spend a lot of my day in heavy development tools such as Eclipse[^1], but often for editing simple XML I just want a quick tool to make fast changes. If I use the CLI (or Linux) it'll be [Vim](http://www.vim.org), if I'm on Mac it'll be [Textmate](http://macromates.com/) but on Windows it's [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/). I haven't found an editor on Windows as clean as Notepad++ (if you use a tool professionally, you get to know it's quirks pretty fast) for editing text of any kind.

Some people I know use awful tools that nag you each time you use them, why go through that pain? In college we used [TextPad](http://www.textpad.com/products/textpad/index.html) for learning Java before we jumped ship to a proper IDE (Netbeans and Eclipse). Textpad has a lot less features then Notepad++ in my mind from using the both of them extensively. In fact the only thing textpad did better was to have a built in macro to run a java program (which can be setup in Notepad++). If you write programs, I can only ask you never touch Notepad (oh my god the wordwrap horror), so give Notepad++ a try!
