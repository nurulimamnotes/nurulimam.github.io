This is a 3rd Graphics project we presented as a group for 
Computer Science. I'd like to thank Mark and James, my team 
members, for all their hard work! The subject of Bauhaus was 
previously discussed in my graphical representation of a 3D 
chess set. The music is courtesy of Jamendo, and is free ;) 
Enjoy it the video!
