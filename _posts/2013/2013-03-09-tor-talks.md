If you haven't heard of Tor, it is alternative internet - one with 
privay in mind. I've recently started to watch a lot of technical 
talks online. The two main guys behind Tor are some of the best 
speakers I've seen. They describe in great detail how open source 
works and the myriad of open source projects around Tor in this talk:

and in an older talk they describe how countries have tried to censor
Tor and how they have combatted some censorship (interesting for the
technical measures deployed):

Of course as is metioned in the first talk, Tor is mainly funded by the US 
Government. Asked why they should be trusted - they say they shouldn't be.
Don your tinfoil hat now!
