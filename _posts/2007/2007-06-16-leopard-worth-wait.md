If you haven't heard of
Apple's latest Operating system, have a look at Wikipedia Article on
[Mac OS X Leopard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5). Here
are some of the features:  
-   **[Time
    Machine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Machine_(software) "Time Machine (software)")**:
    an automated backup utility which allows the user to restore files
    that have been deleted or replaced by another version of a file.
-   **[Front Row](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_Row "Front Row")**
    currently only available with the purchase of a new Mac, but will be
    included with Leopard. It has been reworked to closely resemble the
    interface used by the Apple TV.
-   **[Photo
    Booth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_Booth "Photo Booth")**,
    currently only available with the purchase of a new Mac, but will be
    included with Leopard.
-   **[Spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaces_(software) "Spaces (software)")**:
    an implementation of "[virtual
    desktops](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_desktop "Virtual desktop")"
    (individually called "spaces"), allowing users to have multiple
    desktops per user and be able to place certain applications and
    windows in a desktop. Users can organize certain Spaces for certain
    applications (i.e., one for work-related tasks and one for
    entertainment) and switch between them.
    [Exposé](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposé_(Mac_OS_X) "Exposé (Mac OS X)")
    will work inside Spaces, allowing the user to see at a glance all
    desktops on one
    screen.[[9]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-Expos.C3.A9InSpaces))
-   **[Spotlight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spotlight_(software) "Spotlight (software)")**
    incorporates additional search capabilities such as [Boolean
    operators](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boolean_operators "Boolean operators"),
    as well as the ability to search other computers (with
    [permissions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permissions "Permissions")).
-   **Redesigned
    [Finder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macintosh_Finder "Macintosh Finder")**:
    a redesigned Finder based on
    [iTunes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITunes "ITunes") 7.
-   **New Desktop**: a redesigned desktop, which is comprised of a
    redesigned 3-D dock which uses a new feature called **Stacks**, as
    well as a new menu-bar which adapts itself to the desktop so
    menu-bar text is easily readable.
-   **[Quick
    Look](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_Look "Quick Look")** This
    allows documents to be viewed without actually opening them in an
    external application.
-   **Universal access**: significant improvements to applications
    including
    [VoiceOver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VoiceOver "VoiceOver"),
    along with increased support for
    [Braille](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille "Braille"), [closed
    captioning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_captioning "Closed captioning")
    and a new
    [text-to-speech](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text-to-speech "Text-to-speech")
    engine.
-   **Enhancements to
    [Mail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mail_(application) "Mail (application)")**
    including the additions of RSS feeds, Stationery, Notes, and to-dos.
    To-dos use a system-wide service that is available to all
    applications.
-   **[Dashboard](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashboard_(software) "Dashboard (software)")
    enhancements**, including
    [Webclip](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webclip "Webclip"), a feature
    that allows users to turn a part of any web page into a live
    Dashboard widget, and
    [Dashcode](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashcode "Dashcode") to help
    developers code
    [widgets](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Widgets "Widgets").[[14]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-8)
-   **[iChat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IChat "IChat")
    enhancements**, including multiple logins, animated icons, and
    tabbed chats, similar to features present in
    [Pidgin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pidgin_(software) "Pidgin (software)"),
    [Adium](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adium "Adium") and the iChat
    plugin [Chax](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chax "Chax"); [iChat
    Theater](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IChat "IChat"), allowing users
    to incorporate images from
    [iPhoto](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhoto "IPhoto"),
    presentations from
    [Keynote](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynote_(software) "Keynote (software)"),
    and videos from
    [QuickTime](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickTime "QuickTime") into
    chats; and Backdrops, which are similar to [chroma
    keys](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_key "Chroma key"), but use
    a real-time difference matte technique which does not require a
    green or blue screen. iChat will also implement desktop sharing, a
    feature previously available with [Apple Remote
    Desktop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Remote_Desktop "Apple Remote Desktop").[[15]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-9)[[16]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-10)[[17]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_v10.5#_note-11)
-   Enhancements to [Parental
    controls](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_controls "Parental controls")
    include the ability to place restrictions on use of the Internet and
    to set parental controls from anywhere using remote setup.
-   **[iCal](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICal "ICal")** calendar
    sharing and group scheduling.
-   Leopard will also include the software assistant known as [Boot

    5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_5 "April 5"),
    [2006](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2006 "2006").This assists the
    installation of [Windows
    XP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_XP "Windows XP") or
    [Windows
    Vista](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Vista "Windows Vista")
    to a separate partition (or separate internal drive) on Intel-based
    Macs.
-   **[Menu Bar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_menu "Apple menu")**
    The new menu bar is now transparent and is no longer rounded like
    all previous Mac OS versions.
-   **[Safari](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_(web_browser) "Safari (web browser)")**
    3.0 will be included.

While some seem to be not impressed by Leopard, it is by all accounts an
OS upgrade, with every major application recieving attention. To me I am
overjoyed the finder is getting a revamp, though I am not certain
following iTunes layout is such a good idea. I think this is Steve Jobs
(CEO. Apple Inc) idea to "switch" windows people since they already use
iTunes, although I am not sure it is the right path. I choose Mac OS X
because its unique, it has a fresh take on how a user interacts with a
computer, moreso than Linux (which adopts tried and true in the case of
Gnome and KDE), and certainly Windows which has only tweaked the look
since Windows 95: its the same concept. The fanning out of dock icons,
and grouping them won't be used by the vast majority of users: its the
same reason they don't use "smart" folders: its a feature that has
little in the way of wide appeal. I know the same can be said of the
dashboard, and I personally will most likely end up buying and using
fanning out and collections in Leopard, but my experience of novices is
that they are afraid of the unknown.  
  
Perhaps why I wrote this is that I don't understand what people really
expected from Apple. Comments such as "everything in Leopard has been
done before", well I think this statement is true of every consumer
Operating System: things (generally) don't get tried out on novice
users. So back to my question: is it worth the wait? Look at the above
list and decide for yourself. I feel Tiger is good enough (then again
Technology never stays still, Bill Gates "128K RAM is good enough for
anyone should tell us that), and I predict Leopard will face adoption
like Windows does: Tech buffs will buy the boxed retail version (I
include myself in this), while everybody else will get it through a new
computer purchase.
