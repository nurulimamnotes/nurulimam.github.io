I heard the news one
hour before it was announced: Apple and EMI are going Digital Rights
Management (DRM) free, albeit at a slightly higher cost and quality. One
of my pet hates is people who bash the European Union, often citing I
will admit its not glowing charachteristics. These same people never
admit the things *Europe does right*, which may well be this hopefully
landslide affect against destroying DRM. To quote [The
Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/04/03/apple_emi_ec_fines/ "The Register: EMI and Apple Deal"):

While although the EU certainly wasn't the main motivation, I think that
was profit, but nonetheless it should be given credit for the stick and
carrot treatment of Apple and the record labels. I count the consumer
organisations of Germany, France and the toughest one to Apple: Norway,
as part of the Europe wide effort. Next the EU aims to get rid of
different pricing structure of iTunes Store across the continent, which
like transatlantic air travel, it could literally 'open up the skies'.
