I managed after ages of trying hard, to get my NAT transverse to work :-) !!
This means the computer sitting in my house should be reachable worldwide at
dueyfinster.com. It's login screen is from Ampache music center, a php+mysql
solution to a large music catalogue such as mine. It means (for those who can
login :-) ) that my whole collection is streamable, downloadable, rateable and
generally all round goodness and what you'd expect from a top class open
source media+web application! I am excited about this, as I have already tried
it from a remote family members house. Unfortunately it does not work too well
half way across the world in the US (speed is \*really\* slow I have been
gleefully informed), but I am not too bothered, upgrades in speed will come
with better broadband (which may be years, this is Ireland). I am trying to
restrict peoples usage of it at the moment, as I really do not want a letter
from my Internet Service Provider!

For those interested in hardware, its a cheapo Dell PC I picked up during the
summer for less than â‚¬400. I'd say I'll get a little more than a year (If I am
lucky) out of it, than I will be asking heavy users of it to donate for new
hardware (likely some weak point in it, methinks), I just hope I won't be the
only heavy user ;-) I also set up proftpd on it, so I should be able to modify
its web directory, and my home directory on it. Check out my hardware page and
see the 2Ghz Dell for the PC I am on about. As and ever, it runs Kubuntu
Linux, and as I write it chugs away gleefully (for now.........)
