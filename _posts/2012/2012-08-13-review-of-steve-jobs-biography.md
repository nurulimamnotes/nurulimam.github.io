I recently finished reading Steve Jobs, the biography by Walter Isaacson. 
I can't add much more then the extensive coverage that it has recieved in the 
press to date. Instead I paraphrase really badly a friend of mine, Noel Hudson:

> All that book thought me was dropping acid and treating people really badly works as a life strategy.

While that's not entirely true it is a humourous look at the books tone. 
It has a grain of truth, Walter Issacson really focuses on the warts and 
all representation of Steve Jobs. He defines him very much in terms of how 
other people percieved him, whether that should have been the mainstay of 
the book is up for debate. Overall it's a good book, what I liked most is 
the history lessons of the creation of the mac and how the Disney/Pixar 
relationship went down before the merger. I also felt Walter Issacson 
left it hanging at the end and that he knows much more that he can't 
publish due to Apple's corporate strategy being tied to Jobs so much 
(like the comment he made about cracking the UI for a TV).

Even so, I'll probably buy the *proper* installment when that is released also.
