We all want to stop spam and phishing domains, it hurts the Internet and
confidence in it. Their is a lot of debate on this issue, even from the
[registrars][]. But I believe, as I know there are probably many out their
like me, that the [Irish Domain Registry][] have taken this one step too far.
One only has to look to [Slashdot][] to see what the rest of the world thinks
about our backwards, censorship-driven domain registry. My favourite rule they
have about domains is perhaps the one which requires the least amount of
bureaucracy:
  
> Personal names must consist of the initial letter from each of two or
> more of the words which comprise the legal personal name of the
> applicant, in the order in which these words occur in the name,
> followed by any two digits to be requested by the applicant. As an
> example, John Citizen could register jc01.ie.

  
This is indicative of a backwards registrar that wants you to accept numbers
in your domain, what the hell? I wouldn't take the dot ie of NG89.ie, it seems
cheap, like a social networking site. One has to only look at Technorati and
the top Irish bloggers to see IEDR is failing in its service to the Irish
people.
  
Sorry to all those people trying to email me, I had a bit of trouble with my
DNS settings. It should be all fixed now!
