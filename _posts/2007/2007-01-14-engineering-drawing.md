a quick post on Google Sketch UP for Mac (also available for Windows),
it is a very nice application. I drew my Engineering project (Leaving
Certificate) on it, to see if it was easy enough for a novice (Read: Me)
to mess around and get something functional out of it. Most people have
heard of Computer Aided Design, but usually the applications are
expensive to say the least. Not so with Google Sketchup, it is totally
free and can import some of the most popular 3D drawing formats. It is
easy to use, but difficult to master is how I would best describe this
product. The video tutorials Google provides on their website is a huge
help, and got me off to a good start. They represented what every
tutorial should be: short, snappy and to the point. The User Interface
should be designed a little better and be a little clearer, but for a
free product, it does exactly what it says on the tin. So I got down to
business, and I present my very first drawing in Google
