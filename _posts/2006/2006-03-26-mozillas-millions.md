Only now is it truly becoming clear, their is [serious money in Open
Source][]/ With [Mozilla][] reported to have made tens of millions of dollars.
One blogger reported 70m was made by the corporation, with a Mozilla insider
confirming thats a reasonable ballpark figure. Christopher Blizzard, board
member of Mozilla, had this to say on his blog:

> Blizzard added that an earnings figure of $72m (£41m) quoted on some

One obvious source of the money is [Google Inc.][], which Firefox gives
prominance to as the default search engine, of the open source browser. Jason
Calacanis, the chief executive of blogging network Weblogs, wrote in his blog
that an unnamed source at BarCampLA told him:

> Calacanis claimed that when a Firefox user does a Google search using
> the browser’s search box, Mozilla receives approximately 80 percent of
> the ad revenue from any associated ad clicks.

Pretty impressive for a company, which only earned 5m in 2004. The continued
success in Firefox is shown in the the 10-fold increase of Mozilla’s profits.
Most People wish Mozilla well, with some questioning the Corporations
commitment to better development, in favour of more lucrative contracts, this,
of course, is denied by everyone at Mozilla Corp. Only time will tell! In the
meantime, rumours are abound, Mozilla is to [distribute its cash][cash] to big
developers, and increase its workforce form 40 to 150.
