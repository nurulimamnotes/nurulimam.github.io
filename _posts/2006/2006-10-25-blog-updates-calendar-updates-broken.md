Well first of all, there has been some blog updates, inspired no less by my
Grandfather! He's at a fragile old age, so he can't read the screen all too
well. This is not a problem however, as he sets all fonts to 16 and higher in
[Firefox][] (which is out of beta and into version 2.0!). That got me
thinking, as I really struggled to read this page being marginally away from
the screen, as I am a [Keratoconus][] sufferer. As a result, I have enlarged
all fonts in my blog, in an effort to make them more readable... I encourage
everyone to do the same, or at least follow the [web standards][] so that it
can be properly auto resized by browsers.
  
Also I have updated my Calendar for well into 2007! All the dates I can forsee
have been duly added and accounted for. Please consult to it and collaborate
(if you have a google account, you can add appointments, invite me to yours
etc.) I use it all the time (especially as I have [iSync][]), which syncs it
to my Nokia 6021) and iPod through iTunes) Google now sends me an
[SMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_message_service) (although it costs
standard rate [13c per message for me] :-( ) two days before every appointment
as a friendly reminder.
  
As the title reads, my Macbook was well and truly borked, well at least the
charging function is. I rang [Apple][], which were more helpful than I
expected. They offered to send me a replacement charger, which I offered to
take, but the operator agreed with my assesment that it was the [Power
Management Unit][], and that another AC adaptor would not cut it. I have since
taken it to an Apple service center, called [Mactivate][]. Also just a quick
footnote, but I recently read of spammers hiring people in the third wirld to
read [capthcas][] (like ones I use) and post [spam][]. It seems I may have
been affected by this, luckily it was still filtered by [akismet][]!!
muhahahahaha
