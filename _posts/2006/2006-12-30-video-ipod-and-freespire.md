Well I guess you can call me a hardcore [Apple Computer](http://www.apple.ie
"Apple Computer") fan, I have a Macbook, an iPod Nano (1st Gen 4GB) and now a
80GB iPod Video! I bought i for a couple of reasons, namely price and storage.
I had been put off before since I thought they were too bulky ( I know a
couple of people who have older generation iPod Videos) after being with the
Nano for over a year (its still chugging along gleefully). What can I say? I
am impressed! Battery life is huge to me and well to be frank, its amazing. My
first MP3 player was a Creative Nomad Jukebox II (circa 2002), which I still
have. I know only one person who owned an MP3 player before me, and its nice
to be there from the start, you appreciate the little details most people
don´t, as they are new to mp3 players, so they expect it as standard. I now
get all the latest tech podcasts, so I am very happy with that!

Another thing is I now have [Freespire][], the Open Source version of
[Linspire][]. Linspire is a commercial Linux distribution, so they include all
of the proprietary codecs most others simply can´t for reasons of cost.
Freespire is not up to [Ubuntu][]s standard (not as big pool of
developers/community) and the stable version uses an out-dated [KDE][] and a
horrible menu. Despite this, it has its charm, like click and run, a better
implementation of the APT packaging system (common to [Debian][s]-based
distros) and is probably the easiest distro I have seen to install and run. It
don´t have a partitioner, so it will overwrite Windows (Hey not always a bad
thing ;-) ). But setup is easy, and I love the way it brings you to configure
your own settings at one simple screen after an install. My family love it,
and complement it left-right and center! So although Ubuntu is nice and
cleaner (suitable for people new to computers), Freespire definately wins over
the Windows fans!
