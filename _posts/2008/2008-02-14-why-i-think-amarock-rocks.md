I just purchased
an [Amarok
hoodie](http://49100.spreadshirt.net/en/DE/Shop/Article/Index/article/Amarok-Hoodie-Navy-1117657)
and[t-shirt](http://49100.spreadshirt.net/en/DE/Shop/Article/Index/article/Amarok-Classic-Sports-Tee-1094948);
and I couldn't be happier supporting one of my favourite open source
projects! What makes it so good? Have you ever heard of Amarok? Chances
are if your an OS X or Windows user; you haven't. All this is about to
change! The amarok team are busy porting it from it's UNIX underpinnings
to Windows and OS X.

Whats to like about Amarok
then?](http://amarok.kde.org/features)[![image](http://rokymotion.pwsp.net/promowiki/images/1/18/Amarok_Features-covers.png)](http://rokymotion.pwsp.net/promowiki/images/1/18/Amarok_Features-covers.png)  
-   The blazingly cool name: Amarok is an intuit name for a wolf and
    also is cool phonetically: am a rock!
-   Album covers in full glory (see picture right)
-   Full lyrics support; even for the most obscure songs you have laying
    around!
-   Wikipedia integration: truly a gem; you can do what Amarok says
    "Rediscover your Music" in looking up artist, song or album in the
    free encyclopedia.
-   Playlists form the backone of the player; great for people like me
    who like to compile sub-sections of songs for car journeys and the
    like!
-   Smart playlists: you get playlists which can update based on how
    your rate them; which artist or what genre; sorting conditions ar
    infinite! Example is a 5 Star playlisat with all my top rated tunes!
-   [Dynamic
    playlists](http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Dynamic_Playlist_Walkthrough):
    built from your static and smart playlists; it can show the last X
    songs you played and Y upcoming. So I could select my 5 star faves
    and my Strokes favourites; set it to show 5 last played songs and 15
    upcoming. I never need to edit the playlist again as it will auto
    choose and update the list!
-   Statistics: Show all your stats on your collection! From favourite
    artists to most played albums: it's all there waiting!
-   [Last.fm](http://last.fm/) & Tags: Tag and compiles your music
    listening tastes with integration in the most popular social music
    site online!
-   IPod integration is second to none (as well as many 0ther popular
    players!)! Amarok will convert it to mp3; sync podcasts and
    playlists; transfer ratings and even submit listened tracks to
    last.fm!
-   All the added extras: Equaliser with presets; Random and Repeat
    capability; Visualisations! You can even sort you collection by mood
    with Moodbar installed!  
-   Scripts!?! One of the coolest thing is scripts: think Firefox
    extensions only slightly more powerful!
-   Built-in editing of song names; album names and all info! Don't
    bother telling Amarok to add the music you just ripped; as long as
    it's in your music folder its automatically picked up and added!
-   An intuitive interface: built for function and power: Amarok is
    almost perfect in its balance between feature and function. The OSD
    )On-Screen Display) with show you any details your playlist does;
    like Artist Name; Album name; Rating and how long a track is!

Man I am exhausted already and I haven't even covered all of the
features; their is just too many hidden gems I wouldn't be doing you
justice by telling you them all (see: Scripts)! That's why Amarok rocks
my world! (As a side note: [yes I will get my picture on this page
eventually!](http://amarok.kde.org/wiki/Users_in_Amarok_Gear))
