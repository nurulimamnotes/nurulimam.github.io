I downloaded [Firefox 3.1 beta
2](http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/all-beta.html) (after trialling
other development snapshots over the last few months) to see [Ogg
Theora](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ogg_Theora) video support is coming
on really well. [Opera](http://www.opera.com/), as well as
[Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) has committed to including this
royalty-free video codec for web use. This is really good news; [as one

So all that basically means that video should be a first class citizen
of the web like images. For too long has it been wrapped up in Flash and
Silverlight. They could still wrap ogg theora and degrade nicely if no
plugin for their format is detected (dependent on Adobe and Microsoft
which is unlikely). Anyhoo enough of all this text; how about some nice
video?!?
