Dell Computers has started
selling Ubuntu Linux 7.04 on consumer machines in the United States.
This can only be good news, as a supporter of Linux since late
2004/early 2005 I am fully behind this initiative to put Linux as a
choice in front of people who buy computers. They are testing the market
at the moment which explains why they are shipping stock drivers with
the hardware, and no multimedia codecs (which is unfortunate, but
understandable that this deal was done in 60 days). I think this is
quite an achievement for Canonical and Mark Shuttleworth (Ubuntu
Founder), as they get to do the traditional Linux business model: you
pay for support, and if you don't need it, you don't buy it. This could
confuse some people in the shorter term, but long term its a winner:
Dell does what it does best (Hardware) and Software is left to Ubuntu's
parent company Canonical. This is opposed to Microsoft getting Dell to
provide support for both hardware and software, sometimes a messy
business in which the consumer does not know which to turn to and can
often be left out in the cold. I hope Dell extends this to Europe and
6the rest of the world soon, and makes a decent stab at promoting a free
software desktop. Dell list advantages in one of their videos:  
-   Free to use
-   Upgrades are free
-   All major software included
-   Not prone to Viruses/Spyware/Malware
-   As easy (if not easier) to use than Apple Mac OS X / Microsoft
    Windows
