It's been over a week since I received my Garmin Zumo 660 
Motorcycle GPS unit. I thought I'd give it a run-down for 
potential buyers on my experience for the first week. Firstly 
I should mention, I've never owned another Garmin unit, and had 
two mobile GPS' units before (one being Nokia N800 with Bluetooth 
external GPS and other Apple iPhone 3G). The reason I bring this up 
is that a lot of the reviews I've seen written compare it to it's 
predecessor, Zumo 550, which obviously I can't do.

## Maps
What good is a GPS without good map quality? Garmin's maps are 
by Navteq, and generally are of a good standard here in Ireland. 
The only roads it has presented trouble with are roads that have 
opened in the last 6 months, which I guess were too soon to be 
compiled in to the quarterly updates they provide (of which one 
should be free when you register). Lane assist comes with the unit, 
and although only works for me with high profile and busy junctions, 
it is well worth the inclusion.

##Custom Maps
Garmin allow a cool feature called custom maps, which means you can 
overlay images, giving the edge GPS co-ordinates, so that your map 
can replace a section of theirs. A good example would be replacing 
Dublin Zoo map with all the attractions (Lions, Tigers etc) visible 
on your GPS. Similar to this is a not oft published feature allowing 
you to have supplemental maps, be they Garmin official (I have Australia 
and New Zealand) or from other sources, such as OpenStreetMap (OSM). 
OpenStreetMap is always more up-to-date than any maps Garmin will release, 
but accuracy is always a problem given the wiki nature. Nevertheless OSM can 
include contours in a topographical style, which are the most expensive maps 
to purchase.<br /><br />POI<br />POI stands for Points Of Interest. They are 
the Hospitals, Restaurants and Fuel stations listed on your unit. While 
Garmin's included list is good and somewhat comprehensive, OpenStreetMap 
ones were good to have. Most of the OSM ones end up in the wrong format 
and look slightly odd, but are fairly accurate. You can only have one 
set of custom Points of Interest, so it's worth bearing that in mind 
if you need more (combine them).

## Setting up the unit
Set-up is extremely straight forward and doesn't require more skill 
than hanging a picture really. You get a RAM mount, which you can 
choose to either use the U bracket or the clutch handle mount, fitting 
almost all motorcycles. I had to use the clutch mount on my motorcycle, 
I simply didn't have the bar space to mount the unit anywhere else. The 
RAM Mount plate screws into the Garmin mount, and the ram mount is held 
on to the base by a dual ball and socket joint, allowing maneuverability 
on the GPS. There's a thumb screw on the ball joint to stop it moving 
when a comfortable position is found.

I then wired the units four molded wires (all in one wire until the end run) 
under my tank, with the<br />positive and negative to their respective terminals 
on the battery. I didn't want to fiddle around with my ignition, so I 
just wired it direct (Garmin says it draws less than 1/2 milliamp 
with no unit in place), which after a week doesn't seem to have 
affected my battery. Their is a fuse on the positive side, so that 
is a welcome addition. The other two wires are 3.5mm female jacks 
for connection to a pre-existing motorcycle entertainment unit, or 
for using directly. I;ve used the 3.5mm jack directly for headphones, 
and found they worked well (although bog standard headphones in helmets 
can be sore and you have to make sure to 'detach' yourself getting off). 
For those reasons I've been looking at purchasing a Scala G4 Powerset 
Bluetooth headset (which incidentally comes in a bundle with the TomTom 
Competitor: The Rider).

I paired my current phone, Apple iPhone 3G without any issues. It will 
load your phonebook on to the device, but does not do this immediately 
(let it stay actively paired for a while), although immediately after 
pairing you can dial any number you like. I've only dialed using the 
inbuilt mic and speaker on the unit while stationary and the quality 
seemed acceptable, but would definitely be more useful if a headset 
was used. No SMS functionality is available which is an Apple limitation, 
disappointing in my opinion (would like to see SMS' pop up onscreen!). 
You can see compatible phones on Gamin's Bluetooth phone list.

## Using Computer Software
I've only used BaseCamp and it's poorer cousin RoadTrip on Apple Mac OS X, 
which is the main mapping and routing software (on Windows it's called MapSource). 
I'll start off with the biggest limitation: crappy maps on your computer. 
The software (probably due to licensing) only comes with a very poor 
'basemap' which is a bog-standard zoomed out view on the map. If you 
like me wanted to look at your favorite locations, your out of look as 
they'll appear on a blue sea-like background. I 'fixed' this by using an 
OpenStreetMap (which incidentally is a good way to test accuracy for your locale).

Also for Windows and Mac is POI Loader, which helps you load any custom 
Points of Interest you may have.m As I mentioned earlier, only one "extra" 
(in addition to Garmin included ones) set can be loaded on, so if you want 
say custom speed cameras and Open Street Map POI or Geocaching locations, 
you'll have to combine them using other tools first.

## Geocaching
Geocaching is GPS treasure hunting, for want of a better explanation, or 
see Groundspeak's informative video. GPS units with a good accuracy level 
are needed, as well as good maps. Some of the most popular units used are 
topographical ones, but you can use a road GPS like the Zumo 660. Geocaching 
used to require printing out co-ordinates and clues, and then inputting that 
manually. I found an excellent website/guide to do Paperless Geocaching. 
You need to subscribe to Geocaching.com to get the relevant points around 
you, but you get a lot of information in to the Zumo - like size of the cache, 
logs of people who last found it, the hint, the location blurb and so on.

If you never done Geocahcing.com you can join and print caches for free, then 
input co-ordinates in to the Zumo (Where to? Menu > Co-Ordinates) to see 
if you like it. The only major difficulty is the last few meters, as you'll 
want to go to in to pedestrian mode, and then use the compass to get the exact 
spot (which you have to look at co-ordinates for). At this point I grow impatient 
and just use my iPhone to get me the last few meters, but it’s only happened 
once. It definitely saves my iPhone battery since the Zumo is run off the 
vehicle, so no worries there. Also cool is the way you can set a distance before 
loading the points, so if you drive past a Geocache location you can be alerted. 
You can set alert distance lower or higher depending on your will (it could get 
annoying in a big city with a large radius!!).

## Logs and Favorites
I found it easy to add my custom locations, such as family, friends etc. It can 
be done through the unit or done through the software on a computer. The computer 
version for some unknown reason won’t use addressing information on the unit, 
so finding the address you need, if present, is best done on the unit. Other 
than that for rural Irish locations, I used Google Maps in Satellite/Map view 
and used the latitude and longitude lab extensions to right click on a place and 
get co-ordinates. I then copy and pasted these in to the Garmin software as a 
custom waypoint (warning: they both use different format for co-ordinates, so 
be careful and double check location after).

Logs are a cool way to check your mileage, average speed, etc. Logs are 
automatically kept each time you select a location to travel to. For those 
of you out there like me, who like graphs, even probably meaningless ones, 
there a good (and free) service from Garmin called: Garmin Connect. You can 
see all your route information on a shareable Google Map, and export it to 
Google Earth. Links to this information can be shared on Twitter, Facebook 
etc. I made a trip out to a friend of mine and within minutes of arriving 
home I sent him the details of my route out to him (which was useful as I 
found it hard to explain all the turns I took getting there).

##Overall conclusion
A well made unit, with regular firmware updates, it's hard not to recommend 
the Garmin Zumo 660 if you can afford the steep price a fully waterproof, 
ruggedized car and motorcycle unit comes in at (about &euro; 550/$750). I got 
mine because I plan to use it for both uses, as well as Geocaching, 
monitoring mileage and routes to save fuel, etc. The mount for me is solid 
when the unit is held (and my unit is exposed, not behind my screen, so it 
gets the wind) but it's hard to know sometimes whether the unit "clicked" 
properly in to the mount. That's obviously a concern since you don't want 
to drop the unit at speed. It has also frozen and shutdown twice, but 
that's been resolved by a firmware update and hasn't happened since.

I like Garmin's interface better than almost any other GPS maker 
(bar Google Maps navigation, which is not as comprehensive yet, and 
only on phones), so ease of use is good in my opinion (esp. with gloves). 
A telling endorsement is the fact BMW and Harley-Davidson embed these 
units with new motorcycles.

Overall a solid unit for the small market of Motorcycle ready GPS units, 
a must buy for bikers who intend to travel and can justify the cost.
