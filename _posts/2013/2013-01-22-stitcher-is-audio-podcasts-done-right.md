Just a quick post about a great application I've seen mentioned by <a href="http://geekbeat.tv/" rel="nofollow">Cali Lewis</a>: <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/">Stitcher</a>. If your a talk radio fan like me, you'll really appreciate this app! Ever since I switched from an iPhone 4 to a Galaxy S3 and stopped using Apple's Podcast application it has been frustrating to keep up to date with podcasts.

I've used BeyondPod on Android (which I've praised before - excellent Google Reader integration). I then tried to search for a third party podcast application on the iPad that would synchronise with Google Reader. First there were none, then some (like Feedler and Instacast) but all have been bitterly&nbsp;disappointing&nbsp;with Google Reader integration. Instacast could import OPML (after a messy bundling of feeds in Google Reader) and Feedler could read the feeds (but not handle the video and audio&nbsp;contained&nbsp;within the feed item properly). To be honest I'd given up hope, I said to myself I'd chalk it up to fate and just buy a Nexus tablet when the iPad 2 was no longer serviceable. But - happily - I was wrong and had been looking in the wrong places...

I'd never heard of Stitcher before, but to my&nbsp;surprise it has all the features I needed: position and read status syncing across all platforms. By all platforms I mean the most important - PC (web version), Android and iOS (iPhone/iPad). It also has a great auto-playlist feature that works on recommendations. If you're a music fan like me who has used these type of services for years (auto playlists) and have always been bitterly&nbsp;disappointed&nbsp;(like I have been)&nbsp;- fear not, I've used it and it actually works. Out of 10 tracks it suggested I probably skipped two clips. Those two I actually listened to before skipping because the rest of the suggestions were so good. Incodentally this is where the name comes from, the act of stitching together short audio clips.

<b>Pros:</b>

<ul>
<li>Free</li>
<li>Covers all the important platforms: Web, Android and iOS (and app looks decent and consistent on each)</li>
<li>Syncs Positions, Read Statuses, Playlists of shows</li>
<li>Has great content and great suggestions</li>
<li>Responsive support (I asked to add podcasts I couldn't find)</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Cons:</b><br />
<br />
<ul>
<li>Bad admob ads in the Android version</li>
<li>Web player could be slicker</li>
<li>Doesn't do video podcasts or music-based podcasfs</li>
<li>Any podcasts outside the US may be hard to find</li>
</ul>
