I feel I need to confess why I am buying a [MacBook][], have I turned soft to
my [Open Source][Open]/[Free Software][] ways? No, definately 100% NOT. I’ll
explain why: I think Apple Computer has an incredible product in Mac OSx. For
anyone who has not used it before, pop into a 3G store and ask to have a go.
When someone releases a good a product as that, they deserve money, in my
opinion. Under “the” free software license ([GNU General Public License][]) it
is permissable for anyone to charge for software licensed under it, as long as
an offer of source code is given (for 3 years afterwards). Deep down I love
[Ubuntu][], and I will install it as soon as possible when they release a
version for the Intel powered Apple computers. In fact I will use my Laptop to
showcase Ubuntu you had of told me November last year I’d spend well over
€1,000 on an [Apple Computer][], I would have told you that I hated Apple, and
would never consider it! What has changed my mind? I got a iPod Nano for
Christmas ‘05 and thought it was great, but the Nano on its own still wouldn’t
convince me to get a Mac. 

I was always going to buy a laptop this year, but the turning point was me
using Mac OSX on a computer in work, that sold it itself. Don’t get me wrong,
I still despise Apple for their copy protection (why can’t I play songs I
bought on non-Apple mp3 players? Its Anti- competitive!) on songs bought on
[iTunes][], but I feel this was [forced by the record companies][record
companies], it just had a nice side affect for Apple to lock people to
[iPods][]. [Mac OS X][] [is built on top of Open Source][Darwin], partly the
reason for it being so good! So in reality, instead of me paying for lets say
RedHat, Suse or Linspire (all Linux) with proprietary drivers and an open
source kernel, I am buying into Mac OS X which also has an open source kernel,
but with more proprietary applications. Also I have Ubuntu on my two desktops,
my [Nokia 770][] runs [Linux][] and I do not use Windows whatsoever. So I am
still as big of a Free and Open Source FanBoi as I ever was, perhaps even
more, hey your talking to a guy who plays [Ogg Vorbis][] on his [rockboxed][]
iPod!
