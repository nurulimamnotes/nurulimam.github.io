Do you say Baybo or Beebo? Do you have a clue what I am on about? Apparently
22 million of you out there will, welcome to [Bebo.com][] the social network
growing faster than ever! *What is a social network? Apparently *(by Google
Definitions)*:*

> The personal or professional set of relationships between individuals.
> Social networks represent both a collection of ties between people and
> the strength of those ties. Often used as a measure of social
> “connectedness”, recognising social networks assists in determining
> how information moves throughout groups, and how trust can be
> established and fostered.

Whats interesting, is the sheer amount of Irish users on Bebo, 500,000! Thats
1/8 of the Irish population! In a recent interview with Matt Cooper on
Ireland’s [Today FM][], Bebo CEO Michael Birch tried to explain it himself,
here are some excerpts:

> Bebo is a social network, and online community. People put content on
> their pages, and link them to others. Worldwide we have about 22
> million, in Ireland we have 500,000. Ireland has the most active
> members in the world. Bebo originally started as a photo sharing
> network. We work with WiredSafety.org, with Perry Afstab, to give
> advice to people to stay safe. We have not have any direct issues
> [related to bullying/abuse]. If you’re shy, its easier to send a
> message [on Bebo]. In Ireland, we are the largest website under Google
> and Yahoo!

I have to admit I own a Bebo page, but I am trying to cut down……Caffeine or
Bebo….ugggh such a hard choice!
