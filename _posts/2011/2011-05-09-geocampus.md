For my final year project, I have done a web application on the 
concept of replacing traditional web applications. I picked an area 
I  was deeply interested in, smart phones. I am an avid iPhone user 
and I  have bought Android phones also, they are great devices I can't 
imagine  not having now that they are here. As part of my thesis I 
touched on the  old way to develop apps, using Symbian C++ or J2ME and 
we've come a  long, long way since then.<br /><br />For those interested, 
I will  publish copy of my thesis after November 2011. I won't publish 
it here  just yet, as the examiners have yet to pour over the contents 
and grade it.

## Some of Summary Conclusions: ##

* Web Apps are definitely desirable, in some cases preferable

* Limited API access in the browser (only Geo-location API possible) really hampers good quality applications

* Web Apps for the moment should stick to being "Magazine" -type  applications, with intelligent and innovative display of information

* The tool-kits/libraries and IDE's really aren't up to scratch just  yet. Things are improving, very slowly though. This area needs a lot  more work from stake holders.

* Prediction: WebGL (an effort to bring 3D) will really drive the push of web apps in next few years (as it did with PC's)

It's going to be interesting over the next few years to see how this space 
evolves. Will it just be iOS and Android with native apps for  each? Will 
we see the market heavily fragmented and thus give web apps the opportunity 
to shine?
