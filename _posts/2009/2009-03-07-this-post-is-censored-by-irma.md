I always hoped for better for Ireland; but it seems the thieving hand of
"rights" organizations which pretend to represent the artist have struck gold.
Being able to cajole and bribe the largest Irish Internet Service Provider
(ISP) - Eircom; has worked only too well. Although Eircom has said it will
only obey by having a court order - it has agreed never to oppose these -
which makes it complicit in the act of censorship. My Letter to Our ISP,
Eircom, IRMA, EFF:
  
> Dear [OUR ISP],  
>   
> We are a loyal customer of yours. We are writing this because we're
> concerned about recent news regarding IRMA (Irish Music Rights Ass.)
> relationship with your company ([the recent letters sent
> out](http://blog.blacknight.com/images/irmaletter.pdf)).  
>   
> It would seem that they are seeking to become self-appointed censors
> of Irish Internet communications. We do not think that a third-party
> company should be permitted to arbitrarily decide which Internet sites
> Eircom users; or more importantly any Irish Internet user should be
> allowed to visit. Will IRMA want to block sites that merely link to
> copyrightable material, proxy sites that circumvent the block, blogs
> that criticize its actions? This is a very slippery slope and should
> be nipped in the bud.  
>   
> In the recent high profile case against The Pirate Bay in Sweden;
> IRMA's handlers (IFPI, RIAA) have shown their hand: they don't even
> understand the underlying technology. John Kennedy, CEO. IFPI:
