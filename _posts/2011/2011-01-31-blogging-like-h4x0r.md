Apologies to those visiting my site recently because:

* It hasn't been updated recently
* I have been changing hosts with it

Let me explain both of these! I have been searching for a good 
blogging engine ever since I have started blogging. I have yet 
to find the perfect one :) Some have come close in completeness 
([WordPress][WP]) or price and ease of use (blogger), but none 
has been all-encompassing. I messed around with a blogging engine 
called [Jekyll][JK] about a year and a half ago, but I never ended 
up deploying it. I had my website most recently on Google Sites, 
and the ease of use was pretty good, but themes-wise it was pretty 
frustrating, also they force an ugly footer on all pages, yuck.

There are a few reasons I have made the switch to Jekyll, mainly 
because I have got the ultimate *cool* factor in the setup 
of all this. I write all of my posts in plaintext, like Notepad 
(for reference for Windows users out there). This means in 100 
years time they'll still be readable (if anyone so wishes to read 
them). I've seen enough computer formats to know each one of them 
suck in some way. Plain text just sucks that little bit less because 
it's been around since the dawn of computer time (bar weird encoding, 
which is sorted now I hope with UTF standard). It also simplifies 
my switch away from Jekyll, which I have learned is the **most** 
important feature of any blogging platform. Jekyll takes this text, 
combines it with some nice visual cruft you see all around the text 
and makes it nicely readable. As it transfers it in to folders as html, 
**any** web server software can serve this website. Making it plain 
html also makes it **lightning** fast to load (since there is no 
PHP or other dynamic languages being used).

So at this point your saying - okay? so what? Well the cool part is 
I use Git to save all my hard work, making undo actions to this 
website (I would say mistakes, but I don't make any :) ) extremely 
easy and fast! Also is the coolness of Dropbox, my whole generated 
Jekyll site is synced to my server to be displayed here as it's 
finished. So it's very, very fast in almost every respect and it's 
backed up like crazy and I use my favourite text editor (in a 
terminal shell if I need) to edit all this loveliness. I was 
partly inspired to do all of this [by this blog post][MetaJack], 
which I'd seen back in 2009 when I was researching Jekyll. 
Although the work in this system is in the setup, it is super 
easy to use once set up. I can even create posts on my iPhone, 
using the many apps which hook in to Dropbox to edit files stored 
there. If you ever wanted to know, that's blogging like a h4x0r!
