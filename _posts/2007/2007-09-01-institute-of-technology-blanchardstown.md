[![image](http://www.itb.ie/site/Images/newitbbanner760x95.jpg)](http://www.itb.ie/site/Images/newitbbanner760x95.jpg)I
have got a place in a 4 year [Bachelor of Science (Honours) in
Computing](http://www.itb.ie/site/courses/bn104.htm), or more commonly
known as Computer Science (or comp sci as I am lazy and like to
abbreviate). This means I might be blogging slightly less sometimes, but
it should be a hell of a lot more interesting and I promise to keep my
posts not too technical as I have up to this point.  
  
I would like to thank you all for subscribing and I hope you'll enjoy
what is to come in the future!!  
  
Many Thanks,

[EDIT]: I thought I'd add this cool map of my Bus ride (I get the train
from my house then its a bus)
