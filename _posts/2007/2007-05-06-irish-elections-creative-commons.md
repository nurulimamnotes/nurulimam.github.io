This
is the text of an email I sent to RTE. In America, CNN Television
network is allowing the copying, remixing and free use of presidential
debates as long as they are given credit, I believe RTE should follow
its lead and extend to other programs:  
> *First of all, sorry this isn't to the right department, I couldn't
> find the right one. The technical department which runs the website
> would make likely be able to deal with and respond to this issue.*  
> * *  
> * I would like to say thank you for the fantastic RTE.IE live service.
> I am writing this email to ask you follow America's CNN in releasing
> Irish Election broadcasts under a permissive license, like Creative
> Commons. This would allow people to reproduce the content freely, and
> give RTE the credit it deserves. Like Democracy, Culture wants to be
> free and open to the people. This could serve as a trial to Creative
> Commons licensing other RTE produced programs.*  
> * *  
> * Thanks for your time, I look forward to your comments/response on
> this issue!*

  
Hopefully I'll get a response!
