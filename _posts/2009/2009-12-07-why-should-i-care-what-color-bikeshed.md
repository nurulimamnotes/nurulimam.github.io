"The really, really short answer is that you should not. The somewhat
longer answer is that just because you are capable of building a
bikeshed does not mean you should stop others from building one just
because you do not like the color they plan to paint it. This is a
metaphor indicating that you need not argue about every little feature
just because you know enough to do so. Some people have commented that
the amount of noise generated by a change is inversely proportional to
the complexity of the change."
