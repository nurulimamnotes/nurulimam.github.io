I haven't been posting much lately because I have been 
working hard to improve the experience of visiting this
website. You may ask *what does that mean?* - well it is
simple. I love going to websites that are uncluttered, 
provide useful information and are to the point. It's
also small things like having a really fast page load
time. So here's a flavour of some of what I have 
been working on lately...


## Navigation improvements

- Brand new menu, which can hold nested menus, images 
and more (much more flexible).
- Proper [Sitemap][], [Atom][] and [RSS][] feeds
- Accessibility keys can now be used to navigate to 
every page on the menu (for screen readers)

## Speed improvements

- Blockquotes are now 100% <acronym title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</acronym> - no images. Other post 
 elements will follow when CSS3 allows.
- I am in the process of downsizing all images 
to thumbnail size (as a bonus if you click on 
it you'll get beautiful full size image goodness)


## Maintainability Improvements

- All posts are now written in Markdown, which is like plain 
text. Makes me updating old posts with bad info way easier.
- The history of every page [in the repository][repo] and can 
be referenced and restored (indeed I use it to constantly 
roll out and back changes/improvements).
- Permalinks will be provided at the end of each page. Posts 
can be safely linked to now and should always work.
- I've started adopting [Microformats][] around the site as 
a way to feed search engines and crawlers more useful information 
on both myself and the websites content
- Similiar to Microformats, I've marked up posts so services 
such as [Readability][] and [Instapaper][] should have no 
trouble parsing out all the stuff they don't need (such 
as site navigation, comments etc.)
- Images are getting or will have alternative tags for the 
visually impaired.

**and more to come...**

There is still going to be a lot of broken posts for various 
reasons - I am doing my best to review and update as many as 
I can. Unfortunately changing blogging platform and having 150+ 
posts (since 2004) doesn't make updates easy, but once things 
are fixed I'll have a better idea of how to avoid such mess 
in future. Do [contact me][] if you see any I have missed!
