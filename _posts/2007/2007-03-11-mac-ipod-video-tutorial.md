I recorded a tutorial,
showing people how to extract YouTube (and other flash based sites
videos') and get them onto your iPod. It was recorded on my Mac, so
unfortunately its Mac specific, but really only iSquint program is, so
if anyone can suggest a replacement on Windows or Linux, I will add it
to the details of the video. I use Garageband for audio, iMovieHD to
edit the video and audio and Copernicus to record my screen. I started
by getting everything I needed ready (all the Firefox tabs etc.) and hit
record in Copernicus. I imported that .mov into iMovieHD, and then
proceeded to open Garageband, watch the video and talk myself through my
own recording. I saved the voice part in Garageband, exported it and
then imported it into iMovie. I checked to make sure the audio and video
lined up perefectly (what I done on screen matched what I was saying)
and then exported it as a .mov from iMovieHD. Then I uploaded the result
to Youtube, which I think for a first try ain't bad!! Watch it here:
