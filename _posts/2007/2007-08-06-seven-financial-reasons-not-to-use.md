I recently read a very insightful article on 7 factors every company
should seriously consider about Microsoft Windows, here they are
summarised:  
  
1. Licensing Costs  
> Everyone in the IT industry today knows that proprietary operating
> systems and the applications that run on them will cost you a lot of
> money on licensing fees. According to a recent Forrester study, U.S.
> companies overall are expected to spend $100 billion on software
> maintenance in 2007.

2. Hardware Costs  
> "You need to throw lots of hardware at it," says Central Desktop
> founder Arnulf Hsu about Windows. The minimum hardware requirements
> for Server 2003 call for a Pentium III 550MHz, 512MB of RAM, and at
> least a 3GB hard drive. Linux, on the other hand, can go on an old
> [Pentium
> II](http://www.cio.com/article/126950/subject/Intel+Pentium+Processors "More stories related to Intel Pentium Processors")
> with only 64MB of RAM and 1GB of hard drive space.  

  
3. Inefficient Security Control  
> It's going to take more labor to keep a Windows system secure. Virus
> makers and crackers target Windows systems because it is easier to
> break into.

  
4. Heavy Vendor Influence  
> Because so many corporations have a company policy that specifies
> "Microsoft-only," it discourages independent thinking and
> technological savvy; many end up simply relying on the sales guy to
> tell them what applications they need.

5. Inefficient use of Manpower  
> While it is true that it is relatively easy to find Windows-skilled IT
> admins, it's still not exactly cheap. Though many Unix-based admins
> are more expensive, it takes fewer of them to maintain more servers,
> which saves money in the long run.

6. Feature Lock-in  
> Proprietary systems like Windows are not easily customizable.
> Companies that need the flexibility to drop in or remove features on
> an as-needed basis find themselves either paying for unneeded feature
> bloat, starving for the features they do need because commercial
> vendors rarely are willing to drop everything to accommodate a one-off
> request

7. Forced Upgrade Path  
> With Microsoft, you're on a forced upgrade path. Once it drops support
> on your version of Windows, you're out of luck when it comes to fixing
> those above mentioned security holes-if you can even continue to use
> that version.

The[full article on CIO is here](http://www.cio.com/article/126950/),
and is a very interesting read (it expands on the points I quoted
above). No person in a company responsible for IT should go without
reading this, especially if your are a "Microsoft-Only" shop.
