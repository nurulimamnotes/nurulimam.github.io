Just a quick 
blurb about some things Microsoft like to say: Don't believe it, well at
least not it all anyway. On the [Irish "Get the Facts"
page](http://www.microsoft.com/ireland/getthefacts/default.mspx "Irish Get the Facts")
(on Windows Server vs. Linux), they make critical errors of judgement a
person reasonably well versed in computing could deconstruct. First of
all, Linux isn't a server, its a kernel, like the Windows kernel. So
comparing "Windows Server 2003" to "Linux" is misleading to say the
least, and stupid to say the most. You could run any server software on
Linux you wished, even Windows Server 2003 if Microsoft ported it! For
the sake of argument, I think they are comparing themselves to Apache,
which runs 60% of worldwide
servers[[1]](http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2007/01/05/january_2007_web_server_survey.html "Netcraft Server Marketshare").  
  
It gets better though! They use Case Studies to show companies who have
switched. Now what they forget to mention, out of the case studies is
that some of the companies still use and sell Linux solutions to
customers (like Rackspace and GoDaddy)! It took me <15 seconds to search
for these companies on Google and find that out. Please Microsoft, save
some face and release actual independent verifiable data. Fact is I
would not buy off a company who can't even defend and sell its products
properly.
