It has been a whirlwind four years, but this day marks the cessation 
of my full-time education for my honours degree. It is an overwhelming 
feeling of relief, joy, sadness and all of the emotions you feel when 
leaving an institution that has been a huge part of my life, if only for 
four short years.

The best part of my course has been without doubt, the friends for life I have made. 
I include everyone in my class in this, but some friends have been truly the 
best anyone could wish for. I dedicate this post to wishing all my classmates 
the very best in whatever they chose to do and hopefully we'll all keep in touch!
