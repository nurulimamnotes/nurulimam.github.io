I just tried Herd 5 of Gutsy Gibbon, a beta release which will be Ubuntu
07.10 released in October. Obviously it is still early stages and a lot
of things aren't working quite as they should, but it looks very
promising. Here's some new stuff which should hit the final release:  
-   Compiz Fusion - Pretty Graphics that leave you in awe...
-   Bullet Proof X - Making sure you'll never see a terminal prompt not
    of your own choosing, basically the graphics server should be
    'bulletproof'
-   Appearance Manager - Making it easier to change yourbuntu's look and
    feel
-   Better Driver Support - More of those restricted drivers to make
    sure you can see your screen and use your wifi card
-   Simplified Codecs install - It will now be painless, install
    ubuntu-restrictedcodecs (or kubuntu-restricted codecs) and you can
    see Youtube in all its glory, play a dvd, watch that porno WMV file
    (just kidding but I think thats all WMV is used for) and other such
    niceties of the propreitry world we have to put up with
-   Firefox Codecs Plugin - Firefox will be hooked up to the package
    manager and prompt to install Flash/Java if you haven't got it
    already, much the same way it prompts to get a codec when you throw
    a file at it that it cannot play in the movie player. The free
    software Gnash replacement for Flash will come as standard and can
    play Youtube Vids.
-   Dual Screen Glory - If your like me you have a nice and small
    portable laptop, but that screen just won't do all of the time,
    thats why I personally have a 19" to plug my 13" MacBook into. With
    Gutsy I should be able to plug and play over DVI.

These are just some of the features that are being worked on for the
final release. Probably not all of them on the list will get into Gutsy
final, but lets hope they do! Gutsy+1 (slated for release April 2008)
has been announced as "Hardy Hereon" and should be a long term release
(5 years server and 3 years desktop updates and
patches).[![image](http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg)](http://blog.kir.com/archives/dell_logo2.jpg)  
  
Dell refunded me â‚¬18.15 for Windows Home Edition, to be honest I thought
I'd get more, but alas that's life.....
