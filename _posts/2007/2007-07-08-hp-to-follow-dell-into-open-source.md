title: HP to Follow Dell into Open Source? and Ubuntu Home Server

HP it seems is responding to Dell's initiative to
sell Ubuntu on their computers. With the Ubuntu Dells reportedly selling
very well and Dell rolling out the program worldwide, this hasn't
escaped the notice of the world's number one computer manufacturer - HP.
This is speculation from blogs that has been going on for months since
Dell started to offer Ubuntu. The Direct to Dell Blog states:

This is very good news indeed and I am glad Dell is being very receptive
to the idea, they even made this humorous video about their new foray
into Open Source:  
  
  
  
[Ubuntu Home Server](http://www.ubuntuhomeserver.org/) is a newly
announced project by Ubuntu community members to compete with [Windows
Home
Server](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/winfamily/windowshomeserver/default.mspx).
Personally I think Microsoft is barking up the wrong tree with this, I
don't think many home users will bother with this type of product, maybe
it will take off in a couple of years, but most people are not
tech-savvy, and even if they are, chances are there already doing this
with Linux, Xbox360 or a PS3. Many people can't tell me even what a
server is, never mind what it can do. Also it won't make sense because
people expect to have everything on their pc ready to go, and to not
have to purchase another one to throw in a storage closet. Nevertheless
to paraphrase Bill Gates and Steve Jobs at D5 Conference: We Built
things we wanted to have. So in that tone and considering the Home
server product is just modified Windows (it would not cost as much as
say a whole new project like Zune or Xbox 360), I can see where
Microsoft is betting that this is one of many avenues in the future.
Personally I think it will be specialised hardware devices that will win
this space, like Intel VIIV, Apple TV or one of the many consoles I
mentioned.
