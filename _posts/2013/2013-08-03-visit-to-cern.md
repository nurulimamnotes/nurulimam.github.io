I am currently in Switzerland on a business trip. In between work, I managed to get some time over the Swiss national holiday to visit the <acronym title="European Nuclear Research Centre">CERN</acronym>. [CERN][] is world famous for the invention of <acronym title="World Wide Web">WWW</acronym> and of course most recently, the almost certainty that the [Higgs Boson][HIGGS] (<acronym title="also known as">aka</acronym>. "The God Particle") - the particle that gives energy mass - exists.


The CERN tour is completely free and highly recommended. I visited the [Atlas experiment][ATLAS] with a colleague (who just so happened to have a Phd. in Physics) and questions were encouraged at every turn. What impressed me the most was the fact that there was no stupid questions. You can be a Phd weilding Physicist or a child and each question was handled the same by the staff. The guide (an active researcher at CERN) even expressed disappointment at the Higgs:

>"We would have liked to have learned something we didn't already know"

The tour itself has a video on CERN's mission and then we had a video of the ATLAS experiment, along with seeing the ATLAS control room. The Globe was closed for renovation unfortunately, but the Microcosm exhibit with a lot of the technology pioneered by CERN was on display. I have to admit as a computer scientist, the technological feats strike me more then the physics ones. It's safe to say I have crossed a must-see off of my list in visiting CERN!
