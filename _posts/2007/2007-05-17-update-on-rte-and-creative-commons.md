Unbeknownst to me, with [my quick thinking on the positive developments
regarding CBS releasing democratic
debates](http://www.dueyfinster.com/2007/05/irish-elections-creative-commons.html "RTE, Irish Elections & Creative Commons")
under a permissive license in the United States has caused
[quite](http://www.ferguscassidy.ie/2007/05/08/one-for-everyone-in-the-audience/)
a [few](http://www.cearta.ie/2007/05/speech-just-wants-to-be-free/)
[Irish](http://www.mulley.net/2007/05/08/first-come-the-parodies/)
[bloggers](http://www.irishelection.com/05/web-roundup-day-10/) to echo
my call on RTE's stance on releasing the Irish Election 2007 debates. If
you agree we should be allowed to download, remix and share the debates
while giving RTE credit for production, please:  
  
[Sign the
Petition!](http://www.petitiononline.com/Speech/petition.html "RTE Creative Commons Petition")  
  
UPDATE: Poll is now closed as the leaders debates are now finished. It
was not my petition, I would have left it open to deliver to RTE anyway
in respect to other programming for their consideration. Thanks to all
who voted!
