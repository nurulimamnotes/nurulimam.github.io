Well another year has passed, so I thought I’d make a short recap of it, and
tell you what I am looking forward to in 2006. The year was firmly in the
hands of mother nature as we saw in both Pakistan, New Orleans/Gulf of Mexico
and the Tsunami’s after effects. International consensus was reached at the G8
as London was being bombed - not by the IRA, but by their new enemies in the
middle east. Iran esculated its pressure on the world by resuming its nuclear
activities. George W. Bush took office in January, much to the distaste of the
Daily Mirror in the UK, who scored their most famous headline, “How Could
59,054,087 People, Be So Dumb?”.

## Good Year For… ##

* For Natural Disasters (Katrina, Earthquake)  
* George W. Bush  
* Daily Mirror (Bush Headline)  
* Charles and Camilla (Wedding)  
* Live 8 and Bob Geldof  
* U2 (How to Dismantle’s Continued Success)  
* Palestine (Regained Control of Gaza Strip)  
* Irish Soccer Team (Knocked out of World Cup)  
* Chelsea (Win Premiership) and Liverpool (Win Champions League)  

## Bad Year ## 
* Catholic Church (Fearns Sex Scandal, Unpopularity of New Pope)  
* Michael Jackson (Didn’t he deserve it?)  
* New Orleans  
* Kashmir (Pakistani Part)  
* Israel (Pullout of Gaza Strip)  
* Liam Lawlor (Died in Car Crash, and Misreports of Prostitution)  
* Ukraine (400% Gas Hikes, Ouch!)  
* Manchester United (Glazer Takeover, Roy Keane Leaves, Vodafone Withdraw Sponsorship) 
* Broadband in Ireland (Still one of the lowest take ups in Europe)  

2005 was a good year for Ireland, as continued growth keeps jobless figures
one of the lowest in Europe. What do we have to look forward to in 2006?
