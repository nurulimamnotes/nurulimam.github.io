Some people make new years resolutions about eating healthier,
exercising more etc. I find that boring, who doesn't want to be
healthier? So I am making a list of technology resolutions:  
-   Learn [C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)) in
    [XCode](http://developer.apple.com/tools/xcode/) on a
    [Mac](http://www.apple.com/getamac/)
-   Make an awesome
    [CRM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management)
    program for [College
    degree](http://www.itb.ie/StudyatITB/bn104.html)
    ([Python](http://www.python.org/), [Google App
    Engine](http://code.google.com/appengine/))
-   Learn [Vim](http://www.vim.org/) and
    [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) bindings, using them for
    code
-   Learn to use [Git](http://git-scm.com/), possibly
    [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/)
-   Learn some [Obj-C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) with
    [Cocoa](http://developer.apple.com/cocoa/)
-   Learn some [C++](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++) with
    [Qt](http://qt.nokia.com/products)
-   Learn [Python

-   Learn more about the [design of Linux
    kernel](http://kerneltrap.org/node/5214) and study some of it's code
-   Do Sysadmin stuff on my server on [Linode](http://www.linode.com/);
    like [setting
    up](http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794776)[Sendmail](http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794776)[,](http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794776)[IRC](http://www.blogger.com/goog_1262610794776)[Servers
    and other stuff](http://library.linode.com/)
-   If I have time, investigate [CakePHP](http://cakephp.org/),
    [Django](http://www.djangoproject.com/), maybe
    [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) ([on
    Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/)?) and it's ilk

That should keep me busy besides college and working! I didn't include
any security stuff, as we're doing best practice for my honours degree
next year. If anyone has any of their own, I'd love to see, or any
resources to help me complete my list \^-\^
Happy 2010!
