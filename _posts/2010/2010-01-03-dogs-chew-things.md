Lesson learned: never leave a expensive. Take these pictures I shot 
after the dog attacked my motorcycle! I still love dogs as pets, 
they are man's best friend and just like best friends they can screw up. 
The only thing I am most upset about now is the dog can't pay for the repairs... 
Forgive and forget Fritzie? Thats a girl... 

P.S. If anyone knows anyone thats in the seat repairing business, let me know! 
I can find almost any other part for my Yamaha YP125 other than a seat, grrrr
