What a fantastic service Google now offer with their Google Video platform.
There are a couple of reasons why I like it, mainly because it is available to
upload your videos on all platforms (Windows, Linux and Mac) and is available
on Mozilla-based browsers (Firefox, Netscape), Opera and Internet
Explorer.This is important in creating a better all round user experience. If
only Yahoo! would follow Googles example and open up Launch Cast to other
browsers besides an outdated version of Netscape and Internet Explorer.

I have a criticism of Google Video also, and that is it takes too long to
approve videos (8 days in my case), the should at least give an expected time-
frame and allow notification through email when your video is accepted and
available live on Google. Other than that the service is pretty good and as it
is still in the Beta testing phase, Google have promised to make it better.
This could be a precursor to Google trying to launch its own media-for-sale in
the form of Music videos, who knows? One things for sure, it is going to steal
the thunder from launchcast.

My first video I have uploaded is below, it is called "**We Hate Coogie Bear :
The Motion Picture**":
