I've only recently started cooking meals from scratch and it's a worthwhile experience! By my side is an awesome cookbook produced by the Health Service Executive (HSE) and Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).

It's generally all healthy food and every recipe indicates cost and portion size. It even has meals for one, meals for weaning babies, desserts, you name it! So what's the cost of this fabulous book? I got it for free. They produce very limited quantities however, but it's worth contacting MABS to see if you can get your hands on a copy.


There's also a <a title="101 Square Meals" href="http://dueyfinster.files.wordpress.com/2012/02/101_sq_meals_1_.pdf" target="_blank">PDF version of the same</a> if you own a digital device to read it on.
