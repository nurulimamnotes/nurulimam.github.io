[AOL][], the longtime dialup king, who esperate to keep customers at its' site
who have switched to broadband, is [offering free dot com and dot net
domains][]. There are a few caches however, one must be in possession of a US
mobile phone (cell) number. Luckily I have a cousin stateside willing to help
out ;-) . I got to register NeilGrogan.com (My actual name) which I hadn't
bothered with before. AOL is the legal owner however, so has all the say
legally to the name. At the minute it provides 100 2GB email accounts with the
free domain, and if you visit the address online, it redirects to an AIM Pages
profile of the owner (for all intents and purposes, it's another social
networking site). Its a good way to drum up interest in its online offerings,
but they should be more flexible. If anyone is in any doubt, this is just an
'alright' kind of deal, AOL say they will give you the option to buy the name
back in the future, but I won't hold my breath.
  
I am a longtime [Google Apps For your domain][] customer, which like AOL is
totally free. Google however help you to register your own domain (which is
not to far off market price at $10) so you legally own it. Google offers
webspace (Google Pages), email (Gmail), Instant Messaging (Gtalk) and a start
page. If anything AOL have a lot of catching up to do, but who knows, maybe
Google will provide free registration in the future? It all depends on ad
revenues likely garnered from the services they offer. [Microsoft also offers
a similiar service][], but I have yet to try it out......
