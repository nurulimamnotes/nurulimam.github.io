Reading my favourite tech news site: Slashdot ( [/.][]), I see the [Internet
Explorer team][] have sent the [Firefox Team][] a nice cake:
  
![MS IE Cake for Firefox

One comment I read said it all really:  
> Seems even the IE team knows that IE is dead.

This is of course just lighthearted banter, but on a serious note, many
Internet Explorer developers have Firefox to thank for a job. Microsoft
disbanded the Internet Explorer team after version 6 and had no plans to make
version 7 until Firefox blazed a trail, irony or what? Here's to many years of
competition between Firefox, Internet Explorer (on whatever platform!), Opera,
Safari, Konqueror and the rest!
