After reading about [Tom Cruise
being banned from filming at certain German military sites because of
his belief in
Scientology](http://uk.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUKL253889920070625?feedType=RSS&rpc=451&sp=true),
I was a bit outraged at first, despite my abhorrence of their beliefs,
which I think are crazy and nonsensical.

So far this seems very unreasonable from the the German Government, to
target a faith based group like that, akin to the Jews perhaps? No, it
is not that at all, Scientology are part of Holocaust denial and
masquerading, blaming it (the Holocaust) on Psychologists. Germany is
just enforcing its rights as a state to use its own systems of law, and
its right to debar anyone whom they see as unfit from entering the
country. If Mr. Cruise was a German citizen, this case would be
different, he most likely would end up in jail like Neo-Nazis do. Is
this unjustified? No I don't think so, although the reporting of it is
unclear at best and confuses people. The German Ministry does not wish
to persecute Mr. Cruise, but as he is a member of an organization who
break a law going back even before L. Ron Hubbard created the myth of
Scientology, a post-World War II law.

What is the picture above you may ask? Well that is the "Threats to
Democracy", a picture taken in Nuremburg, Germany (Photo Credit:
[Caesura](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Caesura)). Once the bastion
of hate that was the Nuremburg Rallies of WWII, it lists (left to right)
Islamic Extremism, Scientology and Organised Crime as the biggest
threats Western Democracy faces in the 21st Century, and I couldn't
agree more. The are all forms of extremism practised by the fringes of
Western Society, and contrary to Western values of the rule of law,
freedom of faith, democracy etc.
