I am writing this because, I regret to say, the stupidity of humanity. People
nowadays define their own law on the Web and the Internet (don’t know the
difference, you should), while disregarding real life. Maybe its a lack of
understanding about technology or law, I don’t know. One things for sure,
common sense can go a long way. [Take for example this website on the
Commitments][Commitments], which prohibits linking from unauthorised sites!
You see? I just broke the law right there, amazing dontcha think? The person
who designed or put the statement up, is a total complete and utter idiot, and
I don’t care if thats considered slander! Imagine if every site was to do
this? Search engines would be just another litagation filled business, like so
many other. With Lawyers reviewing every site to go into the database, Google
would have a handful, maybe a 100 sites, instead of the usual billions it
indexes.

This stupidity isn’t only defined to obscure bands from movies, it also
happens at Reuters, the big multinational news site. In their conditions, it
says you may not cache any part of the story on their website. For those not
in the know, caching is storing a site temporarily (usually) for viewing
later, or to increase load times on often visited webpages (eg. Googles Logo).
Only one problem with this: every browser for more than a decade has done just
this, are we all breaking the law? Also Google, Yahoo! and MSN have vast
caches of sites, incase it is temporarily down while you visit.

My point is this: When people claim to know about Law and/or the interweb,
please check facts first, and be very careful while doing so. Just because the
internet “technically” has no law (standardised one anyway), doesn’t mean
black is the new white, quote sources, state laws and reasearch wether your
mumbo jumbo violates their rights, also state which country your site is
hosted and where complaints can be made. This should be standard practice!
