Hard to believe really, Mr.Gates lists Windows Vista 'innovations'. Now
Apple has been shipping everything he mentions since 2005, and I have
tried Vista, it doesn't even surpass Apples' attempt at the software
(which should be his aim). Some things have been around for years, but
it's how well your software can do it is the key. Personally I wouldn't
tout features that another competitor does better, but thats just me. It
seems irresponsible and unbelieveable the head of a public company can
say and get away with this - not knowing the competition that is. I
wouldn't trust my money to anyone who does not keep up with the latest
and greatest trends in the industry.
